1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,740
建造机器看起来有一种长期的人类兴趣或着迷
There’s been a long-term human interest or fascination in building machines that look

2
00:00:08,740 --> 00:00:14,619
并像我们一样行事。早在18世纪和19世纪，人们就开始建造机器了
and act like we do. Back in the 18th and 19th centuries, people were building machines that

3
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:19,140
他们称之为Automata，这里展示了一些例子。基本上，他们是
they called Automata, and some examples of them are shown here. Essentially, they’re

4
00:00:19,140 --> 00:00:24,350
非常巧妙的时钟工作机器充满齿轮和凸轮等。
very ingenious, clock-work machines filled with gears and cams and so on.

5
00:00:24,350 --> 00:00:29,500
这位右侧显示的作家起草人的例子能够表演
The example the writer draftsman shown here on the right hand side, was able to perform

6
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:35,590
非常非常精细的图纸。这里举一个例子，显示了一只绵羊的图画。早一点
very, very elaborate drawings. An example here, a drawing of a sheep is shown. An earlier

7
00:00:35,590 --> 00:00:41,570
而这一类机器的非常着名的例子就是消化鸭子了
and very famous example of machines of this class is the digesting duck and once again

8
00:00:41,570 --> 00:00:46,010
这是一台钟表机。你用这只鸭子做的是用小食物喂它
it is a clock-work machine. What you’d do with this duck is you would feed it with small

9
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:50,660
它看起来像吃的颗粒，它们会通过消化道
pellets which it would appear to eat and they would pass through the digestive tracts of

10
00:00:50,660 --> 00:00:53,100
鸭子最终排出体外。
the duck and be eventually excreted.

11
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:58,440
他们能够建造一个看起来像生命一样的机器，它会吃掉它会
They’re able to build a machine that appeared to be life-like, it would eat and it would

12
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:05,110
排泄。活着的东西的两个重要功能。那个时候，这个
excrete. Two of the important functions of something that is alive. At that time, this

13
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:09,950
被认为是非常精彩的，技术进步的一个例子，他们是如何做到的
was considered quite wonderful, an example of technological progress, how they were able

14
00:01:09,950 --> 00:01:15,080
制造非常非常逼真的机器。当然，按照今天的标准来看
to build machines that were very, very life-like. Of course by today’s standards, it looks

15
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,240
非常，非常原始，但那时，这是一个了不起的成就。
very, very primitive but at that time, it was an amazing achievement.

16
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:25,190
现在，设计这个的绅士Vaucanson继续做了一些更有用的事情。他
Now, the gentleman who designed this, Vaucanson, went on to do some more useful things. He

17
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:31,470
参与丝绸织造过程的自动化。编织技术是
got involved in automating the process of silk weaving. The technology of weaving was

18
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:37,400
由Jacquard进一步推进，他介绍了控制编织图案的创新
advanced further by Jacquard and he introduced the innovation of controlling the weave pattern

19
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:44,920
通过一系列打孔木卡。所以，这是一种自动化机器和
by means of a series of punched wooden cards. So, this was a form of automated machine and

20
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:49,479
它是可编程的。出来的图案取决于打孔的图案
it was programmable. The pattern that came out depended on the patterns of holes punched

21
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:51,930
在那些木牌里。
in those wooden cards.

22
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,830
CharlesBabbage在怀孕期间接受了打卡控制的概念
The notion of punch card control was picked up by Charles Babbage, when he was conceiving

23
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:04,229
19世纪后期的机械计算引擎。那时他没有技术
a mechanical computing engine in the late 1800s. At that time he didn't have the technology

24
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:10,039
实际构建这台机器，但他介绍了一个非常重要的通用概念
to actually build this machine but he introduced the really important notion of a general-purpose

25
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:15,650
计算引擎及其执行的计算由程序决定。在
computing engine and the computation that it performed is dictated by a program. In

26
00:02:15,650 --> 00:02:19,500
他的情况，输入打孔卡。
his case, input on punched cards.

27
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,090
该机器所体现的思想影响了后来的电子计算设备。为
The ideas embodied in this machine influenced later electronic computing devices. For an

28
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:29,790
例如，在第二次世界大战期间和该机器制造的ENIAC计算机，
instance, the ENIAC Computer that was built during World War II and from that machine,

29
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:35,560
我们可以追踪我们每天使用的计算机，我们的笔记本电脑和移动设备
we can trace a lineage to the computers we use every day, in our laptops and in our mobile

30
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:42,390
当然，手机和计算机是我们今天构建的机器人系统的关键组成部分。
phones, and computers of course, are a critical component of robot systems that we build today.

31
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:48,069
我们或许可以将机器人视为可以为物理世界做事的计算机。
We can perhaps think of a robot as a computer that can do things to the physical world.

32
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:53,230
正如我们今天所知，导致机器人技术的另一个非常重要的创新就是这个
The other really important innovation that led to robotics as we know them today is this

33
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:58,379
第二次世界大战后在美国阿贡国家实验室完成的工作
work that was done after World War II at the Argonne National Laboratory in the United

34
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:04,840
状态。在那里，他们面临着组装核武器的问题。这需要
States. In there, they were faced by a problem of assembling nuclear weapons. This required

35
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:11,510
他们处理，操纵放射性物质。这是一项任务
them to handle, to manipulate pieces of material that were radioactive. This was a task that

36
00:03:11,510 --> 00:03:16,019
不能由人类承担，因为它会伤害或杀死那些做过的人
couldn't be undertaken by human beings because it would injure or kill the people who did

37
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:22,140
那工作。我们需要有机器来处理这种材料，但问题是
that work. We needed to have machines to handle that material instead but the problem was

38
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:27,730
为了操纵这种放射性物质，我们需要大量的技能和智慧，
that we need a lot of skill and intelligence in order to manipulate this radioactive material,

39
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:31,209
所以，他们提出了一个名为远程操作的概念。
so, they came up with a concept called teleoperation.

40
00:03:31,209 --> 00:03:35,629
白大衣的人坐在所谓的主操纵臂上
The people in white coats are sitting with what are called the master manipulator arms

41
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:41,159
所以他们会用手抓住那些武器，然后移动它们。双臂在这里
so they would grab those arms with their hands and they would move them. The arms over here

42
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:47,190
被称为奴隶武器。它们以模仿动作的方式移动
are referred to as the slave arms. They move in such a way as to mimic the motion of the

43
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:52,129
主臂。所以，那些正在进行装配和控制大师的人
master arm. So, the people who were doing the assembly work and controlling the master

44
00:03:52,129 --> 00:03:58,440
武器，奴隶武器在远程房间里进行放射性物质的工作。
arms, the slave arms are in a remote room performing work on the radioactive material.

45
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,250
放射性房间发生的事情的视频会传回给人们
Video of what’s going on in the radioactive room is transmitted back to the people doing

46
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:08,510
与主臂一起工作，这样他们就可以看到电视显示器上发生了什么。他们搬家了
the work with the master arm so they can see what’s happening on a TV monitor. They move

47
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:14,970
主臂，从属臂同步移动并远程执行任务。这是一种技术
the master arms, the slave arms move in synchronism and perform the task remotely. This is a technique

48
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:19,919
称为远程操作。它不是真正的机器人。在某些方面，你可以把它想象成一个非常复杂的，
called teleoperation. It’s not really robotic. In some ways, you can think of it as a very-sophisticated,

49
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:25,869
遥控技术。在这方面完成这项具体任务非常重要
remote-controlled technology. It was really important to achieve this specific task at

50
00:04:25,869 --> 00:04:27,860
阿贡国家实验室。
the Argonne National Laboratory.

51
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:33,259
该技术是现代制造机器人的重要先驱。我们所做的
This technology is an important precursor to modern manufacturing robots. What we do

52
00:04:33,259 --> 00:04:38,059
我们是在主臂和从臂之间切断导线而不是主导线
is we cut the wire between the master arm and the slave arm and instead of the master

53
00:04:38,059 --> 00:04:43,400
我们将命令发送到从属臂，我们将计算机放在那里。所以，电脑
arm sending the commands to the slave arm, we put a computer there instead. So, the computer

54
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,199
将命令发送到将根据信号移动的从属臂
is sending commands to the slave arm which is going to move in accordance to the signals

55
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:53,909
走出电脑。当然，计算机是无限可重编程设备
coming out of the computer. Of course, the computer is an infinitely reprogrammable device

56
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:58,740
因此，我们可以让奴隶臂做任何我们喜欢的事情，现在，那里
so therefore we can make the slave arm do anything that we like at all and now, there

57
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,059
不再涉及任何人类。我们创造了一个机器人。
are no longer any human beings involved. We've created a robot.

58
00:05:03,059 --> 00:05:07,589
也许这个想法最初出现的人是乔治·德沃尔，这位绅士表现出来
And perhaps the person that this idea first occurred to is George Devol, the gentleman shown

59
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:14,050
在这里，一位多产的美国发明家最近才去世。他有创造的想法
here, a prolific American inventor who died only recently. He had the idea of creating

60
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:19,039
他称之为Unimation的通用自动化。那就是
what he called universal automation which was contracted to Unimation. That was the

61
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:24,930
他与JosephEngelberger于1956年创立的公司名称。他们创立了
name of the company that he founded in 1956 with Joseph Engelberger. They founded the

62
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:30,199
该公司生产最终将在通用汽车公司工作的工业机器人
company to produce industrial robots that would eventually go to work in General Motors

63
00:05:30,199 --> 00:05:35,719
植物。这里展示了1961年安装的第一台机器人。这是什么
plants. The first of their robots which was installed in 1961 is shown here. What this

64
00:05:35,719 --> 00:05:40,369
机器人做的是从压铸机上卸下铸件。
robot did was to unload castings from a die-casting machine.

65
00:05:40,369 --> 00:05:46,300
这是制造业中机器人革命的开始。Unimation公司，
This was the start of the revolution of robots working in the manufacturing industry. Unimation,

66
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:51,369
公司是第一家制造机器人的公司。他们是先驱者。他们是
Inc. was the first company to build manufacturing robots. They were the pioneers. They’re

67
00:05:51,369 --> 00:05:56,080
不再是商业和现在，有许多公司建立制造业
no longer in business and today, there are many, many companies that build manufacturing

68
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,389
机器人，但他们中的大多数可以追溯他们的祖先，他们的想法，甚至可能追溯到人们
robots, but most of them can trace their ancestry, their ideas or perhaps even the people back

69
00:06:01,389 --> 00:06:06,749
这家小公司成立于1956年，位于美国康涅狄格州。
to this little company founded in 1956 in Connecticut in the United States.
