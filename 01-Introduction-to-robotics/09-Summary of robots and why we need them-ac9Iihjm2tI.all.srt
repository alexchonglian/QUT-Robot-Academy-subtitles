1
00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:06,410
让我们总结一下我们在本次讲座中学到的内容，并且有一些重要的内容
Let’s summarize what we have learned in this lecture and there are some important

2
00:00:06,410 --> 00:00:11,349
我希望你带回家的消息。第一个也许是最重要的是
messages that I’d like you to take home. The first and perhaps the most important is

3
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:16,410
机器人是真的。是的，有很多关于机器人的小说，书籍，
that robots are real. Yes, there are many depictions of robots in fiction, in books,

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,859
电视和电影，但世界上有许多真正的机器人正在做有用的事情
TVs and movies, but there are a number of real robots in the world doing useful things

5
00:00:21,859 --> 00:00:27,119
马上。接下来的信息是机器人的形式和功能非常多样化。
right now. The next message is that robots are very diverse in their form and their function.

6
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,269
它们看起来不像您熟悉的虚构机器人。我们有
They don’t necessarily look like the fictional robots that you are familiar with. We have

7
00:00:32,269 --> 00:00:38,040
看到了各种各样的现实世界机器人。我们已经看到用于制造的机器人手臂
seen a great diversity of real world robots. We have seen robot arms that are used in manufacturing

8
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,620
植物。我们见过带轮子的机器人。我们见过有腿的机器人。我们见过机器人
plants. We have seen robots with wheels. We have seen robots with legs. We have seen robots

9
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:47,399
可以飞行，我们已经看到可以在水下或机器人船上移动的机器人
that can fly and we have seen robots that can move under water or robot boats that can

10
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:53,270
在水面上移动。我们已经研究过可以执行各种不同操作的机器人
move on the surface of water. We have looked at robots that perform a wide range of different

11
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,340
功能。而且，机器人的形状，就是它的形状
functions. And, the form of the robot, that is its shape

12
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,809
它如何在世界范围内移动，在很大程度上取决于它所需要的功能
and how it moves through the world depends very much on the function that it needs to

13
00:01:00,809 --> 00:01:06,100
执行。所以，如果它需要在空中移动，那么它的形式是飞行器，
perform. So, if it needs to move through the air, then its form is of a flying machine,

14
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:10,860
也许像固定翼飞机或者像直升机一样。如果它必须移动
perhaps like a fixed wing aircraft or perhaps like a helicopter. If it’s got to move across

15
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,860
在湖面上，它会有一个看起来像船的形状。功能
the surface of a lake, then it’s going to have a form that looks like a boat. The functionality

16
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:20,880
机器人正在迅速改善。如果我们看看制造机器人
of robots is improving very, very rapidly. If we look at manufacturing robots from the

17
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,000
1960年代与现在的机器人相比，现代机器人非常可靠，令人难以置信
1960’s and compare it to a robot today, the modern robot is incredibly reliable, incredibly

18
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,000
准确，价格合理。我们对移动机器人看到了同样的事情。
accurate and built for quite a reasonable price. We see the same thing for mobile robots.

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,720
我们看看60年代的StanfordCart或Shakey这样的机器人并将其进行比较
We look at robots like the Stanford Cart or Shakey from the ’60’s and compare that

20
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:43,349
到今天的谷歌汽车。在大约50年的时间里，这是一个非凡的进步
to a Google car of today. That’s a phenomenal amount of progress in a period of about 50

21
00:01:43,349 --> 00:01:45,349
年份。我希望你接受的另一条消息
years. The other message that I’d like you to take

22
00:01:45,349 --> 00:01:50,869
家庭是机器人是解决我们时代一些非常重要的问题的一部分。
home is that robots are part of the solution to some really important problems of our time.

23
00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:55,780
它们将成为为越来越多的人提供负担得起的医疗保健的关键
They are going to be a key to providing affordable health care to the growing number of people

24
00:01:55,780 --> 00:02:00,670
在我们的星球上。它们将在提供基础的行业中发挥重要作用
on our planet. They are going to be important in industries which supply the fundamental

25
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:06,810
我们星球上所有人的原材料，即食物，能源和矿物质。他们
raw materials for all the people on our planet, that’s food and energy and minerals. They

26
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:12,290
在管理和检查所有基础设施方面也将发挥关键作用
will also have a really key role in managing and inspecting all of the infrastructure on

27
00:02:12,290 --> 00:02:18,080
我们现代社会所依赖的。最后，它们在监测中发挥着非常重要的作用
which our modern society depends. Finally, they play a really important role in monitoring

28
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,760
我们所有人生活的星球的健康。出于所有这些原因，机器人技术确实如此
the health of the planet on which we all live. For all of these reasons, robotics is a really

29
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,470
重要的技术。这是今天的一项重要技术。它只会变得更多
important technology. It’s an important technology today. It will only become a more

30
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:30,050
对未来很重要。
important into the future.
