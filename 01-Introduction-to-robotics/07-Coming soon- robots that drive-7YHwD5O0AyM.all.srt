00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:20,509
自驾车技术可能可以追溯到这两个研究机器人

系统重建它所驾驶的世界的三维性质。
system to reconstruct the three dimensional nature of the world in which it’s driving.

它使用该信息来规划路径，以避免碰到任何这些障碍。
It uses that information to plan a path so that it can avoid hitting any of these obstacles.

9
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:49,750
这台机器非常缓慢。主要由有限的计算能力决定
This machine was excruciatingly slow. Mostly dictated by the limited computing power that

10
00:00:49,750 --> 00:00:53,770
早在1964年就可以解决这个问题了。

00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:23,439
制造能够与人类驾驶员一样出色的机器人汽车。他们不得不表演
to build robot cars that could perform as well as human drivers. They had to perform

16
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:29,260
搬进停车位等任务。他们必须在十字路口做正确的事情。
tasks like moving into parking bays. They had to do the right things at the intersections.

17
00:01:29,260 --> 00:01:34,049
他们必须证明他们可以通过技巧安全地超车和所有这些
They had to demonstrate that they could do overtaking and all of this safely with skill

18
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,609
与人类司机相当的水平。
levels comparable to human drivers.

19
00:01:37,609 --> 00:01:42,369
这场比赛的胜利者是卡内基开发的名为“Boss”的机器人车
The winner of that competition was this robot car called, ‘Boss’ developed by Carnegie

20
00:01:42,369 --> 00:01:47,509
梅隆大学，我们可以看到它看起来不像普通的汽车。它的
Mellon University and we can see that it doesn't look anything like an ordinary car. It’s

21
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:52,609
充满了各种各样的感官装置，大部分车都充满了
bristling with all sorts of sensory devices and a large part of the car is filled with

22
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:54,789
高性能计算设备。
high performance computing equipment.

23
00:01:54,789 --> 00:02:01,890
现在技术发展得相当快，所以到2014年，谷歌汽车看起来很多
Now technology has evolved pretty rapidly so by the year 2014, Google cars look much

24
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:06,259
更圆滑。事实上，当你看到它时，只有一个传感器是显而易见的
more sleek. There is really in fact only one sensor that’s obvious when you look at the

00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:11,849
汽车，这是在屋顶上称为Velodyne扫描激光测距仪的设备
car and that is the device known as a Velodyne scanning laser range finder on the roof of

26
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:18,110
车。机器人汽车看待它的世界的方式在这里被称为点云
the car. The way the robot car sees its world is shown here in what we call a point cloud

27
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:24,840
这是由我们在Google汽车上看到的Velodyne扫描仪生成的。
image and this is generated by that Velodyne scanner that we saw on top of the Google car.

28
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,520
点云是三维空间中的多个点，并且它们通常是颜色
The point cloud is a number of points in three dimensional space and they are typically color

29
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,459
编码。因此颜色为蓝色，冷色调表示机器人所在的地平面
coded. So the colors blue, the cool colors indicate the ground plane on which the robot

30
00:02:34,459 --> 00:02:39,760
正在行驶并且指向地面以上的地方可能不明智地驾驶着色
is driving and points above the ground plane where it might be imprudent to drive are colored

31
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,629
绿色或红色表示高于地平面的那些点。所以从此
green or red for those points that are very high above the ground plane. So from this

32
00:02:44,629 --> 00:02:49,861
相当简单的三维几何模型的世界周围的汽车，
fairly simple three dimensional geometric model of the world surrounding the car, the

33
00:02:49,861 --> 00:02:54,790
车上的软件能够做出一些关于哪个方向的决定
software on board the car is able to make a number of decisions about which direction

34
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:55,790
它应该开车。
it should drive.

35
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:01,540
它可以看到其他物体，也许是人类，也许是其他汽车，也许是道路标志。
It’s able to see other objects perhaps human beings, perhaps other cars, perhaps road signs.

36
00:03:01,540 --> 00:03:06,810
车辆上的软件必须采取所有这些丰富的感官信息并创建
The software on board the vehicle has to take all of this rich sensory information and create

37
00:03:06,810 --> 00:03:11,599
一个计划，然后发送命令到汽车调整方向盘或调整
a plan and then send commands to the car to adjust the steering wheel or to adjust the

38
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:13,340
油门或调整制动器。
throttle or to adjust the brake.
