1
00:00:03,209 --> 00:00:08,490
我在20世纪60年代还是个孩子。这是一个技术进步和伟大的时代
I was a child in the 1960s. It was a time of great technological progress and great

2
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,860
对技术的兴奋。也许当时最大的例子是人的空间
excitement about technologies. Perhaps the biggest example at that time was man's space

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:18,160
旅行。这是第一批宇航员进入太空的时候。当我长大的时候，就是这样
travel. It was the time when the first astronauts would go into space. When I grew up, it was

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,099
明确我想成为一名宇航员。
clear that I wanted to be an astronaut.

5
00:00:21,099 --> 00:00:25,649
技术进步的另一个形象是机器人，而此时，主要是机器人
The other image of technological progress was robots and at this time, there were mostly

6
00:00:25,649 --> 00:00:30,979
小说中的机器人。在电视上，当我还是一个孩子长大的时候，其中有很多。
robots in fiction. On television, when I was a child growing up, there were many of these.

7
00:00:30,979 --> 00:00:35,920
然而，早期有许多小说中的机器人描述，也许是第一个
However, there were many earlier depictions of robots in fiction, perhaps the first one

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:42,269
是1927年电影“大都会”中的人物玛丽亚。1951年的机器人Gort，
is the character Maria from the 1927 movie Metropolis. The robot Gort from the 1951,

9
00:00:42,269 --> 00:00:47,989
电影的原创作品“地球静止之日”。那么也许，我的
the original make of the movie “The Day the Earth Stood Still”. Then perhaps, my

10
00:00:47,989 --> 00:00:53,649
1956年电影“禁忌星球”中他最喜欢的机器人罗比出现在
all time favourite robot Robby from the movie Forbidden Planet in 1956 and he appeared in

11
00:00:53,649 --> 00:00:58,739
其他一些后续电影。毫无疑问，这两个最着名的虚构机器人
a number of other follow-up movies. Without doubt, the two most famous fictional robots

12
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:05,519
这两部是原始的星球大战电影，它于1977年首次亮相，R2D2和他的
are these two from the original Star Wars movie, which debuted in 1977, R2D2 and his

13
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:08,340
健谈的朋友C3PO。
talkative friend C3PO.

14
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:13,399
这两个角色描绘了机器人是良性的。这对周围的人有帮助
These two characters depict robots as being benign. That is helpful to the people around

15
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:20,920
他们也非常聪明，能够用人类语言进行对话
them and also as being incredibly intelligent, able to hold conversations in human languages

16
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,930
并能够执行复杂的工程任务，如黑客入侵死星。
and being able to perform complex engineering tasks like hacking a Death star.

17
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:31,700
这部最近的电影机器人和弗兰克描绘了一个非常合理的未来，一个老人
This more recent movie Robot and Frank depicts a very plausible future where an old person

18
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:38,130
辅助机器人正在协助他们的日常生活，这是一个人形机器人
is being assisted in their daily life by a helper robot and this is a robot that is humanoid

19
00:01:38,130 --> 00:01:44,649
在形式上，能够用自然语言与主角弗兰克交谈，引导他吃饭
in form, able to converse with the main character Frank in natural language, guide him to eat

20
00:01:44,649 --> 00:01:47,659
更好，并改变他的一些坏习惯。
better and to change some of his bad habits.

21
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:53,469
但是，我们在小说中看到的所有机器人就是这样。他们是虚构的。所以，机器人
However, all robots that we see in fiction are just that. They are fiction. So, the robot

22
00:01:53,469 --> 00:02:00,340
从大都会电影的方式回到1927年，确实是一个金属西装里面的人。
from the Metropolis movie way back in 1927 was indeed a human being inside a metallic suit.

23
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:06,200
你认为，1927年的技术真的很漂亮也许并不奇怪
You think, well that is probably not surprising that technology back in 1927 was really pretty

24
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:12,830
原始但它实际上没有太大变化。在20世纪50年代，机器人罗比也是人类
primitive but it hasn't actually changed much. In the 1950s, Robby the robot was also a human

25
00:02:12,830 --> 00:02:15,310
在一个大金属套装里面。
being inside a large metallic suit.

26
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:22,200
所以，即使在最初的星球大战电影中，C3PO也是演员安东尼丹尼尔斯
So, it goes even in the original Star Wars movies C3PO was the actor Anthony Daniels

27
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:31,380
在金色金属套装里面。因此，对于R2D2来说，R2D2中的演员肯尼贝克也是如此。
inside a gold metallic suit. So, it also was for R2D2 the actor Kenny Baker inside R2D2.

28
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:35,750
自星球大战电影专营权开始以来，很多其他电影都有
Since the beginning of the Star Wars movie franchise very many, many other movies have

29
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:41,080
出来并向我们介绍特定的机器人角色，并描绘了他们的一些名字
come out and introduced us to particular robot characters and some of their names are depicted

30
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,250
这是时间的函数。
here as a function of time.

31
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:48,820
事实上，您可能会惊讶地发现您认为自己知道或认识的机器人数量。我喜欢这个
In fact, you might be surprise how many robots you think you know or recognize. I love this

32
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:55,150
特别的漫画，由RichardSergeant提供，展示了各种各样的虚构机器人和

33
00:02:55,150 --> 00:02:59,890
这是一个有趣的练习，看看你能辨认出多少机器人
it is an interesting exercise to go through this and see how many robots you can recognize

34
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,730
在这个场景中。这些解决方案可在网上获得。
in this scene. The solutions are available on the web.

35
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:08,630
除了电视和电影中机器人的所有描绘之外，还有
In addition to all the portrayals of robots in television and movies, there have also

36
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:14,350
大量的书籍，科幻小说都以机器人为主题
been a large number of books, Science fiction books which are based on the theme of robots

37
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:20,820
和机器人和人类之间的相互作用，良好的互动和不良的互动。
and interactions between robots and humanity, both good interactions and bad interactions.

38
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:27,430
机器人这个词本身就是捷克语，它意味着像工人或奴隶这样的东西
The word robot itself is a Czech word and it means something like worker or slave and

39
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:35,700
它是由捷克剧作家卡雷尔·卡佩克（KarelCapek）于1920年创作的。他的戏剧名为
it was coined in a 1920 play by the Czech playwright, Karel Capek. His play was titled

40
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:42,340
罗森的通用机器人或RUR。该剧的主题是人们创造机器人
Rossum's Universal Robot or RUR. The theme of the play is that people create robots to

41
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:48,490
减轻他们日常体力劳动的苦差事。机器人最终得到了反感
relieve them of the drudgery of everyday physical work. The robots eventually get to resent

42
00:03:48,490 --> 00:03:53,800
他们在社会中的角色是做所有工作的人。他们起来了，他们反叛
their role in society as being the ones who do all the work. They rise up, they rebel

43
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:59,230
他们杀了人类。所以，这是许多机器人中非常反复出现的主题
and they kill the human beings. So, this is a very recurrent theme in many many robot

44
00:03:59,230 --> 00:04:04,280
电影是在这一天制作的。我们可以把它想象成一种重新解释
movies being made to this very day. We can think of it perhaps as a reinterpretation

45
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:09,080
至少在此之前的一百年里，弗兰肯斯坦的故事。
of the story of Frankenstein from at least a hundred years before this.

46
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:13,360
几年前我有机会到布拉格，我去了并表达了我的敬意
I had the opportunity to be in Prague a few years ago and I went and paid my respects

47
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,340
去了KarelCapek，我去了他的坟墓，这里有一张照片，我很高兴
to Karel Capek, I went and visited his grave and a photograph is shown here and I was delighted

48
00:04:19,340 --> 00:04:25,229
看到有人在他的墓碑上留下了一个小模型机器人。我希望我有想过
to see it that somebody has left a small model robot on his headstone. I wish I had thought

49
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:27,180
这样做我自己。
of doing that myself.

50
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:32,580
也许最能在小说中推广机器人理念的作者是
Perhaps the author who has done the most to popularize the idea of robots in fiction is

51
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:39,180
艾萨克·阿西莫夫（IsaacAsimov），一位非常非常多产的美国科幻作家。一个关键要素
Isaac Asimov, a very, very prolific American writer of Science fiction. A key element of

52
00:04:39,180 --> 00:04:45,620
几乎所有阿西莫夫的故事都是他的机器人法则。在他的故事机器人中，这些
almost all of Asimov's stories are his laws of robotics. In robots in his stories, these

53
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:51,770
每个机器人的正电脑都嵌入了法则。机器人无能为力
laws were imbedded in the positronic brain of every robot. The robots were incapable

54
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:57,520
违反任何这些法律。如果你看，这些法律在面值，他们都做了
of violating any of these laws. If you look, these laws at face value, they all make a

55
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:03,240
很有意义，虽然在阿西莫夫的大部分故事中，总有一些皱纹或角落的情况
lot of sense, though in most of Asimov's stories, there was always some wrinkle or corner case

56
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:08,210
在法律的实施，法律与人类或与人交往的方式
in the implementation of the laws, the way the laws interacted with human beings or with

57
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:09,390
其他机器人。
other robots.
