1
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,019
如果你今天要求人们说机器人的样子，他们要么告诉你
If you ask people today to say what a robot looks like, they're either going to tell you

2
00:00:08,019 --> 00:00:13,450
关于一个虚构的机器人，比如R2D2，或者他们会提到这样的制造机器人
about a fictional robot, like R2D2 or they're going to mention a manufacturing robot such

3
00:00:13,450 --> 00:00:19,090
就像这里展示的一样，今天有很多这样的机器人在地球上工作，
as the one shown here and there are many many of these robots at work on the planet today,

4
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:25,460
超过100万，他们支持许多现代制造业，汽车，
more than 1 million of them and they underpin a lot of modern manufacturing, of automobiles,

5
00:00:25,460 --> 00:00:28,400
电子设备，如电脑。
of electronic devices, like computers.

6
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,000
他们还进行了大量的物料搬运，将箱子从传送带上移开并放置
They also do a lot of material handling, moving boxes off conveyor belts and putting them

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,510
在装运纸箱时，甚至拿起装运纸箱并将它们放在托盘上
in shipping cartons, even picking up shipping cartons and putting them onto pallets and

8
00:00:38,510 --> 00:00:44,350
等等。像这样的机器人代表了第一代机器人。他们真的很直接
so on. Robots such as this represent the first generation of robots. They are really direct

9
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:50,950
我们在上一节谈到的UnimationInc.创建的机器人的后代。
descendants of the robots created by Unimation Inc. that we talked about in the last section.

10
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:55,300
这是一个现代制造机器人的例子。这是我拍摄的视频
Here's an example of a modern manufacturing robot at work. This is a video that I took

11
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:00,090
在去年的机器人展览会上。我们可以看到机器人正在移动和拾取
at a robot exhibition last year. And what we can see is the robot is moving and picking

12
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:04,780
从斜坡底部的水桶中取出一块，你可以看到它们的碎片
up a piece from the bucket at the bottom of the ramp, and you can see that the pieces

13
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:09,909
都是在不同的方向，机器人有一些传感器，以便它可以确定
are all in different orientations and the robot has got some sensors so that it can determine

14
00:01:09,909 --> 00:01:14,929
为了拾取物体需要采用的夹具的方向，以及
the orientation of its gripper that it needs to adopt in order to pick-up the object, and

15
00:01:14,929 --> 00:01:19,509
一旦它完成了，将它移动到坡道的顶部并让它去。这个机器人是
once it has done that, moves it to the top of the ramp and lets it go. This robot is

16
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:26,020
执行无限循环从位置A拾取物品并将其放在位置B.
performing an endless loop of pick up the thing from location A and drop it at location B.

17
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,439
另一种机器人就是这个。这是机器人吸尘器，这是一项技术
Another type of robot is this. This is the robot vacuum cleaner and this is a technology

18
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:36,319
这是在2004年左右推出的，从那时起它们变得非常受欢迎，
that was introduced around 2004 and since that time they became enormously popular,

19
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:41,520
其中已售出1000多万件。那么我们看到的制造机器人片刻
more than 10 million of them have been sold. So the manufacturing robot that we saw a moment

20
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,409
以前是一项近60年的技术，其中有一百万在工作。这个
ago is a technology that's nearly 60 years old and there’s a million of them at work. This

21
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:52,060
只有十多年历史的技术已售出超过1000万件。
technology which is only just over a decade old has sold more than 10 million of them.

22
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:56,950
这些机器人如此受欢迎的原因之一是它们执行一项非常有用的任务，一项任务
One of the reasons these robots are so popular is they perform a very useful task, a task

23
00:01:56,950 --> 00:02:02,200
人类不喜欢这么做，他们以非常低的价格做到这一点。原因
that human beings don't like doing so much, and they do it for a very low price. The reason

24
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:07,559
他们能够以如此低的成本制造机器人，它的计算量非常有限
that they're able to build a robot for such a low cost is it has got really limited computational

25
00:02:07,559 --> 00:02:13,719
能力和机器人能够通过采用非常简单的策略来清洁地板。
capability and robots are able to clean the floor by adopting a very very simple strategy.

26
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:17,659
机器人实际上并不知道它在哪里。它的作用只是直线驱动
The robot doesn't actually know where it is. What it does is just drives in a straight

27
00:02:17,659 --> 00:02:22,459
线，吸收污垢，直到它碰到障碍物并从障碍物反弹然后去
line, sucking up dirt until it hits an obstacle and bounces off the obstacle and then goes

28
00:02:22,459 --> 00:02:24,549
在另一个方向。
in a different direction.

29
00:02:24,549 --> 00:02:30,030
所以这张时间流逝图片显示了Roomba机器人清洁起居室的路径
So this time lapse picture here, shows the path of a Roomba robot cleaning a living room

30
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:35,170
我们可以看到它从墙壁和家具上弹开的地方。采用这个
and we can see where it's bounced off the walls and off the furniture. By adopting this

31
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:39,450
非常简单的策略，我们可以覆盖整个房间。但很明显，有些部分是
very simple strategy, we can cover the whole room. It's clear though, that some parts of

32
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:44,590
房间被遮盖很多次，房间的某些部分不经常被遮盖
the room are covered many many times and some parts of the room are covered not very often

33
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:47,489
一点都不我们可以想象扩大像这样的技术
at all. We can imagine scaling up a technology like

34
00:02:47,489 --> 00:02:53,019
真空吸尘器到机器人系统，能够拿起和放下容器
that vacuum cleaner to a robot system that's able to pick up and put down containers in

35
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:57,239
一个航运港口，事实上人们已经建立了远程系统来做到这一点。
a shipping port, and in fact people have built remote systems to do this.

36
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:03,299
因此，这些机器人在位置A拿起一个集装箱，然后将它们运送到位置B.
So these robots pick up a container at location A and transport it to location B, when they

37
00:03:03,299 --> 00:03:09,579
再说一遍。在制造过程中将材料从位置A移动到位置B的机器人
put it down again. Robots that move materials from location A to location B, inside manufacturing

38
00:03:09,579 --> 00:03:14,430
植物现在非常普遍，这使它们与第一代植物分开
plants are now really quite common, and this separates them from the first generation of

39
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:19,700
机器人。制造机器人固定在世界上的一个地方，
robots. The manufacturing robots which are fixed at a single place in the world, the

40
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,909
下一代机器人能够在环境中移动。
next generation of robots are able to move within the environment.

41
00:03:23,909 --> 00:03:28,459
在这里，我们看到一个叫做小狗的研究机器人，它起到了非常重要的作用
Here we see a research robot called little dog, and it played a really important role

42
00:03:28,459 --> 00:03:35,749
研究我们如何计划机器人放置脚的地方以便合理地行走
in research into how we plan where robots place their feet in order to walk competently

43
00:03:35,749 --> 00:03:39,980
在非常粗糙和不平坦的地形。
over very rough and uneven terrain.

44
00:03:39,980 --> 00:03:44,370
在这里，我们看到小狗的大哥哥，逻辑上称为大狗，这是一个机器人
Here we see the big brother of little dog, logically called big dog, and this is a robot

45
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:49,620
在现实的室外，它可以在非常崎岖的地形上承载相当大的有效载荷
that's able to carry quite a large payload over very rough terrain in realistic outdoor

46
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:55,400
环境。在这里，我们看到了这个机器人走过的稳定性的演示
environments. Here we see a demonstration of the stability of this robot walking over

47
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,440
冰和被踢在一边，能够恢复平衡，继续走路。
ice and being kicked in the side and able to recover its balance and keep on walking.

48
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:10,980
我们再一次看到它能够从非常困难的情况中恢复过来的精彩演示。
Once again we can see a wonderful demonstration of its ability to recover from very very difficult situations.

49
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:26,139
除了轮子和腿，机器人也可以飞行，人们已经证明了
In addition to wheels and legs, robots can also fly and people have demonstrated very

50
00:04:26,139 --> 00:04:32,060
像左翼的全球鹰这样的大型飞行机器人真的很小
large scale flying robots like the Global Hawk here on the left and really, really small

51
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:38,840
飞行机器人显示在右侧。那么机器人的定义是什么？一个定义
flying robots are shown here on the right. So what's the definition of a robot? A definition

52
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:42,240
我喜欢很多并且我认为它实际上非常有用，即使它可能也是如此
that I like a lot and I think is actually very very useful, even though it's perhaps

53
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,250
有点简单，它是一台将东西从A移动到B的机器。现在，它是可编程的
a little simple is it's a machine that moves things from A to B. Now, it's a programmable

54
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:53,250
因此我们可以控制位置A和位置B以及位置A
machine so we can control the location A and the location B and perhaps the location A

55
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:58,900
是机器人从其传感器中获取的信息的函数。但最简单的
is a function of information that the robot picks up from its sensors. But in the simplest

56
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:03,470
例如，机器人是将东西从A移动到B的机器。
case, a robot is a machine that moves things from A to B.

57
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:08,389
从移动机器人，例如那些有轮子或腿或螺旋桨并可以飞行的机器人，
From mobile robots such as those that have got wheels or legs or propellers and can fly,

58
00:05:08,389 --> 00:05:14,020
我们可以将其视为从位置A自动移动到位置的机器
we can think of it as a machine that moves automatically from location A to location

59
00:05:14,020 --> 00:05:20,289
B.我喜欢的机器人的高级别，更复杂的定义是面向目标的
B. A high level, a more complex definition of a robot that I like is it is a goal-oriented

60
00:05:20,289 --> 00:05:26,449
可以感知，计划和行动的机器，这个短语捕获，我认为这四个真的
machine that can sense, plan and act, and this phrase catches, I think the four really

61
00:05:26,449 --> 00:05:30,860
机器人的关键元素。首先，它是一台拥有的机器
key elements of a robot. The first thing is, it's a machine that has

62
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:35,509
一个目标。它想要实现某些东西，它希望从一个产品中实现
a goal. There's something that it wants to achieve, it wants to deliver itself from one

63
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:40,590
放在另一个地方，或者它想把东西从一个地方搬到另一个地方，这就是它
place to another or it wants to move something from one place to another, so that is its

64
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:41,560
目标。
goal.

65
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:45,500
在制造机器人的例子中，我们看到它能够感知到哪里
In the example of the manufacturing robot, we saw that it was able to sense where are

66
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:51,090
它想要拾取的白色物体。我们看到一只小狗走路机器人，它
the white objects that it wanted to pick-up. We saw with a little dog walking robot, it

67
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:56,030
能够感知其环境的形状，以确定它的脚应该在哪里
was able to sense the shape of its environment in order to determine where its feet should

68
00:05:56,030 --> 00:06:01,080
那就把我们带到下一部分，就是计划。一旦机器人感觉到了
go and that brings us then to the next part, that is to plan. So once the robot has sensed

69
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,590
它在哪里并感知到它正在移动的环境，然后它
where it is and sensed something about the environment in which it's moving, then it

70
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:11,849
制定计划，让机器人更接近目标，并按顺序创建计划
makes a plan to bring the robot closer to its goal and once it's created a plan in order

71
00:06:11,849 --> 00:06:15,270
为了更接近目标，它就会行动起来。
to move closer to its goal, then it acts.

72
00:06:15,270 --> 00:06:20,560
它移动轮子，移动腿，它按顺序改变螺旋桨的速度
It moves the wheels, it moves the legs, it changes the speed on the propellers, in order

73
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:26,310
让机器人更接近目标。并且它不断重复这三个动作。
for the robot to get closer towards the goal. And it repeats these three actions continuously.

74
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:32,289
它感觉到，它计划，它的行为。它再次感知世界的状态，并更新它
It senses, it plans, it acts. It senses the state of the world again and it updates its

75
00:06:32,289 --> 00:06:37,800
计划，然后它的行为更多，依此类推，直到达到目标。有什么特点
plan and then it acts a bit more and so on until it reaches the goal. What are the characteristics

76
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:43,110
机器人？为什么机器人对我们有用？嗯，他们有许多优点。首先
of robots? Why are robots useful to us? Well, they have a number of merits. First of all

77
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:49,860
机器人非常一致，他们一直关注，不像人类。
robots are very consistent, they pay attention all the time, unlike human beings.

78
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:54,750
机器人也非常准确。我们之前看到的制造机器人能够定位
Robots are also very accurate. The manufacturing robots that we saw earlier are able to position

79
00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:00,849
每次执行时，机器人的末端精确到几分之一毫米
the end of the robot to an accuracy of a fraction of a millimeter, every single time they perform

80
00:07:00,849 --> 00:07:06,569
操作，他们也非常非常可靠。他们可以24点到7点工作。他们没有
the operation and they're also very, very reliable. They can work 24 by 7. They don't

81
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:11,039
甚至需要打开灯才能完成他们的工作。所以这意味着机器人能够
even need the lights on in order to do their job. So this means that robots are able to

82
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,289
做一些人们做不到的事情。他们可以进入太空，他们可以深入
do a number of things that people can't do. They can go into space, they can go deep into

83
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:22,039
人类无法生存的海洋。他们也做那些事情
the oceans where human beings are just not able to survive. They also do things that

84
00:07:22,039 --> 00:07:26,189
人类不会这样做。这些工作无聊或乏味。
human beings won't do. These are jobs that are boring or dull.

85
00:07:26,189 --> 00:07:32,319
而且越来越多的农业和制造业都有很多低技能工作
And increasingly there are a lot of low-skill jobs in agriculture and in manufacturing where

86
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:37,250
很难找到愿意做这项工作的人。这些都是人类的工作
it's very difficult to find human beings willing to do that work. These are jobs human beings

87
00:07:37,250 --> 00:07:43,280
现在考虑在他们之下，不会做。现在机器人将进入这项工作
now consider are beneath them and won't do. Now robots are going to move into that job

88
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,360
真空。最后，机器人做了人们不应该做的事情。他们可以完成工作
vacuum. And finally, robots do things that people shouldn't do. They can perform jobs

89
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:54,530
这是危险的，不健康的或危险的，也就是说，机器人会让人们摆脱伤害
that are dangerous, unhealthy or risky, that is, the robots take people out of harm's way

90
00:07:54,530 --> 00:07:58,169
而且我认为这是机器人可以做的非常棒的事情。
and I think that's a very great thing that robots can do.

91
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:03,069
人们经常使用“肮脏，沉闷和危险”的表达来反映这三个类别
People often use the expression, 'dirty, dull and dangerous' to reflect the three classes

92
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:08,669
机器人比人类有相当大优势的工作。肮脏而危险
of jobs where robots have considerable advantage over human beings. The dirty and dangerous

93
00:08:08,669 --> 00:08:13,000
工作是人类不应该做的工作，枯燥的工作是人类的工作
jobs are the ones that human beings shouldn't do and the dull jobs are the ones that human

94
00:08:13,009 --> 00:08:14,529
众生不想做。
beings don't want to do.
