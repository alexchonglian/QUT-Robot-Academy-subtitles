1
00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:05,500
让我们考虑一个更复杂的案例。
Let’s consider a more complex case.

2
00:00:05,500 --> 00:00:08,889
我想从这个特定的X值开始。
I want to start at this particular X value.

3
00:00:08,889 --> 00:00:11,720
我想完成这个特定的X值。
I want to finish at this particular X value.

4
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:16,379
但是，介于两者之间，我想访问这个X值和这个X值。
But, in between, I wanted to visit this X value and this X value.

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:19,810
我将这些中间点称为通过点。
I refer to these intermediate points as via points.

6
00:00:19,810 --> 00:00:24,050
有时，它也被称为路点。
Sometimes, it’s also referred to as way

7
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:28,400
如果一个机器人要做这个特定的动作，我们的轨迹就会出现问题
If a robot is going to do this particular motion, we have a problem in that the trajectory

8
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:29,789
不顺利。
is not smooth.

9
00:00:29,789 --> 00:00:34,829
在每个点处，速度突然从一个值变为另一个值。
At each of the points, the velocity abruptly changes from one value to another.

10
00:00:34,829 --> 00:00:37,360
在这里，速度在增加。
Here, the velocity is increasing.

11
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,030
片刻之后，速度在下降。
A moment later, the velocity is decreasing.

12
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:44,230
我们解决这个问题的方法是引入所谓的混合。
The way we get around this problem is to introduce what are called blends.

13
00:00:44,230 --> 00:00:49,390
所以在这里，我们有这些点之间的运动和红色，它显示了混合
So here, we have the motion between these points and in red, it’s shown the blend

14
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:50,390
相。
phase.

15
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:55,550
现在，我们在这里引入一条保持连续性的平滑数学曲线。
Now, this is where we introduce a smooth mathematical curve which maintains continuity.

16
00:00:55,550 --> 00:01:00,190
因此，最初，我们加速到曲线并前往X2。
So, initially, we accelerate on to the curve and head towards X2.

17
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:06,710
当我们接近X2时，我们开始转换到我们需要的速度到下一个
When we get near X2, we start to transition in to the velocity we require on to the next

18
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:07,710
路径。
path.

19
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:12,690
因此，我们将速度转换为设定的时间段，超过所谓的加速度
So, we transition our velocity over a set period, over what’s called the acceleration

20
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:13,690
间隔。
interval.

21
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:20,060
因此，我们的路径现在由具有抛物线或更高阶多项式的线速度段组成
So, our path now consists of segments of linear velocity with parabolic or higher-order polynomial

22
00:01:20,060 --> 00:01:22,730
混合将它们连接在一起。
blends to join them together.

23
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,810
我们可以根据三个部分来考虑这项议案。
We can consider the motion in terms of three segments.

24
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,740
第一段从第1点到第2点，第2段从第2点到第2点
The first segment gets us from point 1 to point 2, second segment from point 2 to point

25
00:01:30,740 --> 00:01:32,720
3等等。
3 and so on.

26
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,800
因为你现在可能已经注意到机器人实际上没有进入通道
Because you probably noticed by now that the robot isn’t actually getting to the via

27
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:37,800
点。
points.

28
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,860
它越来越接近X2，然后它将转向前进的道路
It’s getting close to X2 and then it’s going to turn to get on to the path to head

29
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,860
走向X3。
towards X3.

30
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:47,400
所以，它错过了X2然后实际上也错过了X3。
So, it misses X2 and then actually misses X3 as well.

31
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,680
现在，这只是一个折衷。
Now, this is just a bit of a trade off.

32
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:54,750
如果加速时间非常小，那么我们将非常接近通孔点，但是
If the acceleration time is very small, then we will go very close to the via points, but

33
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:56,590
加速度会很高。
the acceleration will be very high.

34
00:01:56,590 --> 00:02:01,520
我们将不得不前往X2，然后非常非常快地改变我们的速度
We’re going to have to head towards X2 and then very, very quickly change our velocity

35
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,450
我们需要前往X3的速度。
in to the velocity we need to head towards X3.

36
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:09,429
如果加速时间很长，那么机器人的加速度要低得多，但是
If the acceleration time is large, then the acceleration of the robot is much lower, but

37
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:13,349
我们将错过更多的通过积分。
we’re going to miss the via points by a larger amount.

38
00:02:13,349 --> 00:02:18,700
这是精度和加速度之间的基本工程权衡。
This is a fundamental engineering trade off between accuracy and acceleration.

39
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,500
让我们创建一个带有via点的轨迹。
Let’s create a trajectory with via points.

40
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,900
我们要访问的第一点的值为10。
The first point we want to visit has got a value of 10.

41
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:31,420
我访问的最后一点的值为30。
The last point that I visit has got a value of 30.

42
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:39,529
并且，我将设置为40,10和最后一个。
And, the via points I’m going to set as 40, 10 and the last one.

43
00:02:39,529 --> 00:02:44,879
为了计算带有通孔点的轨迹，我使用了工具箱函数mstraj和它
To compute a trajectory with via points, I used the Toolbox function mstraj and it’s

44
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:46,719
得到了很多争论。
got rather a lot of arguments.

45
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,790
第一个参数是通过点。
First argument is the via points.

46
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:54,469
下一个参数是我们移动的速度，它将是每个单位的一个单位
The next argument is the velocity at which we move, and it’s going to be one unit per

47
00:02:54,469 --> 00:02:55,469
第二。
second.

48
00:02:55,469 --> 00:02:59,139
第三个参数我将暂时设置为null。
The third argument I’m going to set to null for the time being.

49
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:03,569
而且，我将把我们想要访问的第一个位置放入。
And, I’m going to put in the first location that we want to visit.

50
00:03:03,569 --> 00:03:11,249
我要把时间间隔放进去，我要加速加速时间。
I’m going to put in the time interval and I’m going to put in the acceleration time.

51
00:03:11,249 --> 00:03:13,769
而且，这是我们的轨迹。
And, here is our trajectory.

52
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:18,849
我们已经从10上升到40，然后回到10到30。
We’ve gone from 10 up to 40, back down to 10 and up to 30.

53
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:22,980
现在，让我们看一下当我们调整一些参数时会发生什么。
Now, let’s look at what happens when we adjust some of the parameters.

54
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:25,930
我要做的第一件事就是增加加速时间。
The first thing I’m going to do is to increase the acceleration time.

55
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:30,799
所以，我要把它从2增加到4，我们可以看到轨迹已经变成了
So, I’m going to increase it from 2 to 4 and we can see that the trajectory has become

56
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:31,799
更圆润。
more rounded.

57
00:03:31,799 --> 00:03:36,819
并且，我们还可以看到轨迹错过通孔点的距离增加了。
And, we can also see the distance by which the trajectory misses the via points has increased.

58
00:03:36,819 --> 00:03:41,279
我可以进一步增加加速时间，把它增加到8，我们可以再次看到
I can increase the acceleration time even more, put it up to 8 and we can see again

59
00:03:41,279 --> 00:03:47,159
因为加速度更加温和，所以轨迹更加圆润
that the trajectory is much more rounded because the acceleration is much gentler but, the

60
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:51,419
轨迹和通孔点之间的距离进一步增加。
distance between the trajectory and the via points is increased even further.

61
00:03:51,419 --> 00:03:56,750
如果我将加速时间设置为0，我们确切地到达了通过点，但轨迹将是
If I set the acceleration time to 0, we exactly reach the via points but the trajectory will

62
00:03:56,750 --> 00:03:58,169
是不连续的。
be discontinuous.

63
00:03:58,169 --> 00:04:00,849
通孔点的加速度无限大。
The acceleration will be infinite at the via points.

64
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:03,970
让我们回到更温和的东西。
Let’s go back to something a little bit more gentle.

65
00:04:03,970 --> 00:04:09,859
而现在，我要做的是提高我们沿着轨迹移动的速度。
And now, what I’m going to do is to increase the velocity at which we move along the trajectory.

66
00:04:09,859 --> 00:04:14,420
您现在可以看到此轨迹需要将近90秒才能执行。
You can see right now that this trajectory takes nearly 90 seconds to execute.

67
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:18,800
所以，我要将我们沿着轨迹移动的速度加倍，改变速度
So, I’m going to double the speed at which we move along the trajectory, change the velocity

68
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:24,720
从1到2，现在我们在不到50秒的时间内执行轨迹。
from 1 to 2, and now we execute the trajectory in just under 50 seconds.

69
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,210
我要做的最后一件事是删除速度规范并替换
The last thing that I’m going to do is to remove the velocity specification and replace

70
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:32,129
它有时间规格。
it with a time specification.

71
00:04:32,129 --> 00:04:37,210
我要说我不关心速度，但我确实关心时间。
I’m going to say that I don’t care about velocity, but I do care about the time.

72
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:40,180
而且，我想指定细分的时间。
And, I want to specify the times of the segments.

73
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:43,070
我希望第一段持续10秒。
I want the first segment to last for 10 seconds.

74
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:45,770
我希望第二段持续30秒。
I want the second segment to last for 30 seconds.

75
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,620
并且，我希望最后一段能够持续20秒。
And, I want the last segment to last for 20 seconds.

76
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,870
现在，轨迹看起来像这样。
And now, the trajectory looks like this.
