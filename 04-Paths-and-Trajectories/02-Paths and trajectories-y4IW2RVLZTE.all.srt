1
00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:06,980
我们都非常直观地了解路径是什么。
We all have a pretty intuitive idea of what a path is.

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:12,610
我们认为它是从A地到B地的一种方式。
We consider it as a way of getting from place A to place B.

3
00:00:12,610 --> 00:00:17,400
我们可以将它视为一组连接A到B的点;我们的一系列小步骤
We can consider it as a set of points that link A to B; a set of small steps that we

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:18,960
一路走来。
take along the way.

5
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,679
路径是空间构造。
A path is a spatial construct.

6
00:00:21,679 --> 00:00:25,829
它说明了我们如何通过世界从A到B，但它没有说
It says something about how we get from A to B through the world but it doesn't say

7
00:00:25,829 --> 00:00:29,400
关于我们应该多快移动它的任何事情。
anything about how quickly we should move along it.

8
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,230
没有时间概念。
There's no notion of time.

9
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,590
另一方面，轨迹包括从A到A的路径和时间表
A trajectory on the other hand comprises a path and a schedule for getting from A to

10
00:00:36,590 --> 00:00:40,520
B.所以沿着这条道路有一个时间或速度的概念。
B. So there is a notion of time or speed along the path.

11
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:45,750
这是我需要在特定时间内完成的一系列要点。
It's a set of points that I need to be at by a particular time.

12
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:52,530
在我的MATLAB工作空间中，我有两个姿势表示为4x4齐次变换
In my MATLAB work space, I have got two poses represented as 4x4 homogeneous transformation

13
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,809
矩阵。
matrices.

14
00:00:53,809 --> 00:00:59,829
由工作空间变量T0表示的第一个姿势没有旋转并且具有它
The first pose represented by the workspace variable T0, has got no rotation and has its

15
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:03,989
起源于世界坐标系的原点。
origin at the origin of the world coordinate frame.

16
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:09,520
由工作空间变量T1表示的第二个帖子在x方向上包括1的集合
The second post represented by the work space variable T1, comprises set of 1 in the x direction

17
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:15,250
在y方向上的图2和在z方向上的3和由辊间距描述的取向
2 in the y direction and 3 in the z direction and an orientation described by roll pitch

18
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:20,840
偏航角分别为0.6,0.8和1.4弧度。
yaw angles 0.6, 0.8 and 1.4 radians respectively.

19
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:24,210
我们可以想象出这些姿势。
And we can visualize each of these poses.

20
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:30,880
我可以绘制姿势T0，我们可以看到它的起源是世界的起源
I can plot the pose T0 and we can see there its origin is at the origin of the world

21
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,880
帧。
frame.

22
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,000
它的轴与世界框架对齐。
And its axes are aligned with the world frame.

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:43,690
我可以绘制另一个姿势T1，我们可以看到它的起源不是原点
I can plot the other pose T1 and we can see that its origin is not at the origin of the

24
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:49,100
世界参考系及其轴与参考轴不平行。
world reference frame and its axes are not parallel to the reference axes.

25
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:56,939
现在我可以为从姿势T0到姿势T1的运动设置动画，我们可以看到我们的坐标
Now I can animate the motion that goes from pose T0 to pose T1 and we can see our coordinate

26
00:01:56,939 --> 00:02:03,990
框架正在平移和旋转，以便从姿势T0移动到姿势T1。所以这
frame is translating and rotating in order to move from pose T0 to pose T1. So this

27
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:10,259
当我谈到一个从一个姿势到另一个姿势的平滑运动的轨迹时，我的意思是
is what I mean when I talked about a trajectory which is smooth motion from one pose to the

28
00:02:10,259 --> 00:02:11,259
下一个。
next.

29
00:02:11,259 --> 00:02:13,900
弄清楚如何做到这一点是本讲座的主题。
Figuring out how to do this is the subject of this lecture.
