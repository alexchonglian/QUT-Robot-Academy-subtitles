1
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,910
常用的替代速度曲线如下所示。
A commonly used alternative velocity profile looks like this.

2
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,080
我们加速。只要我们需要，我们以恒定速度移动
We accelerate. We move at constant velocity for as long as we need to

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:16,139
然后我们尽快放慢速度。
and then we slow down as quickly as we can.

4
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:21,910
像这样的轨迹的一个优点是我们可以更快地到达目的地。
An advantage of a trajectory like this is that we get to our destination much more quickly.

5
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:26,369
两条曲线下方的区域是行进的距离，两者中的区域相同
The area under the two curves is the distance travelled, and that's the same in the two

6
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:32,009
案例。只是红色曲线更加紧凑。它只需要35个时间单位
cases. It’s just that the red curve is much more compact. It only takes 35 time units

7
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:34,620
而不是50个时间单位。
instead of 50 time units.

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,120
这种运动被称为梯形轮廓。它的名字取决于它的形状
This kind of motion is referred to as a trapezoidal profile. It's named after the shape of the

9
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:47,040
速度曲线。这是一个梯形。它包括一个加速阶段，一个滑行阶段-在哪里
velocity profile. It’s a trapezoid. It comprises an acceleration phase, a coasting phase - where

10
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:53,280
我们以恒定速度移动-然后是减速阶段。在加速期间和
we move at a constant velocity - and then a deceleration phase. During acceleration and

11
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:00,110
减速时，速度是时间的线性函数。这意味着，该位置是抛物线
deceleration, the velocity is a linear function of time. Which means, that position is a parabolic

12
00:01:00,110 --> 00:01:06,200
时间的功能。在滑行阶段，速度是恒定的。这意味着
function of time. During the coasting phase, the velocity is constant. That means that

13
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:12,520
位置轮廓是一条直线。所以，这种运动轮廓，梯形
the position profile is a straight line. So, this kind of motion profile, the trapezoidal

14
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:18,659
轮廓，有时也被称为具有抛物线混合的线性段。在
profile, is also sometimes referred to as a linear segment with parabolic blend. In

15
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:23,969
机器人工具箱，它是函数LSPB，它是线性段的收缩
that robotics toolbox, it's the function LSPB which is a contraction of a linear segment

16
00:01:23,969 --> 00:01:25,810
与抛物线混合。
with parabolic blend.

17
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:30,959
梯形轮廓的缺点是加速度不连续
A disadvantage of the trapezoidal profile is that acceleration is not continuous and

18
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:36,880
当我们从加速阶段转换到惯性阶段和滑行到减速时，你可以看到它
you can see it when we change from acceleration phase to coasting phase and coasting to deceleration

19
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:42,899
阶段，加速阶段存在阶梯不连续性。这对某些机器人来说可能存在问题
phase, there is a step discontinuity in acceleration. This is potentially problematic for some robots

20
00:01:42,899 --> 00:01:47,090
但总的来说，我们依赖于运动控制系统的带宽这一事实
but in general, we rely on the fact that the bandwidth of the motion control systems is

21
00:01:47,090 --> 00:01:52,770
相对较低并且平滑了加速度的这种不连续性。
relatively low and it smooths out this discontinuity in acceleration.

22
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:58,969
让我们使用MATLAB工具来看这种类型的轨迹，我将创建一个梯形
Let's look at this type of trajectory using the MATLAB tools, I am going to create a trapezoidal

23
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:04,979
使用MATLAB函数LSPB的轨迹，它是LinearSegment的首字母缩写
trajectory using the MATLAB function LSPB which is an acronym for Linear Segment with

24
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:09,929
抛物线混合。它将以零值开始。它将完成
Parabolic Blend. It's going to start with the value of zero. It's going to finish at

25
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:16,980
一。我们将以50次步骤完成。而且，在这里我们看到了轨迹。我们可以清楚
one. We're going to do it in 50 times steps. And, here we see the trajectory. We can clearly

26
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:22,810
看到速度曲线是梯形的。我们可以看到加速阶段，常数
see that the velocity profile is trapezoidal. We can see the acceleration phase, the constant

27
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:27,980
速度阶段和减速阶段。并且，这些不同的阶段是彩色编码的
velocity phase and the deceleration phase. And, these different phases are color coded

28
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:33,989
在S与时间步骤的关系图中。我可以改变轨迹。所以，而不是从
in the plot of S versus time step. I can change the trajectory. So, instead of going from

29
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:39,980
零到一，从零到零。而且，现在的轨迹看起来像这样。所以，
zero to one, it goes from zero to minus one. And, the trajectory now looks like this. So,

30
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:49,269
那么，我可以要求S的值，从50到1的步数为0。它创造了
then, I can ask for the values of S, from zero to one in 50 times steps. And it creates

31
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:56,049
工作区代码S中有50行的向量。每行对应一个时间步。
a vector in the workspace code S which has 50 rows. Each row corresponds to a time step.

32
00:02:56,049 --> 00:03:01,819
就像tpoly函数一样，我也可以询问速度和加速度
And just like the tpoly function, I can also ask for the velocity and the acceleration

33
00:03:01,819 --> 00:03:08,290
反过来，我们将SD和STD放入工作空间，这里它们也在工作空间中
which in turn, we put into the workspace SD and STD and here they are also in the workspace

34
00:03:08,290 --> 00:03:12,340
作为50个元素向量，每个时间步长一行。
as 50 element vectors, one row per time step.

35
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:19,510
我将回到我的第一个例子。从零到一的轨迹。我们可以看到
I'm going to return to my first example. A trajectory from zero to one. We can see that

36
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:25,849
线性段的速度略高于0.03。我们现在要做什么
the velocity of the linear segment is a little bit above 0.03. What we are going to do now

37
00:03:25,849 --> 00:03:32,120
是覆盖自动选择线性段的速度。而且，我要走了
is to override the automatic choice of the velocity of the linear segment. And, I'm going

38
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:41,329
建议使用0.025的值代替。而且，在这里我们可以看到轨迹正在发生
to suggest that it use a value of 0.025 instead. And, here we can see the trajectory is being

39
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:45,959
计算。您会看到线性段现在更长并且抛物线混合
computed. You see that the linear segment now is much longer and the parabolic blends

40
00:03:45,959 --> 00:03:53,159
要短得多。我建议它使用稍大的速度值
are much shorter. I am going to suggest that it uses a slightly larger value of velocity

41
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:58,040
对于线性段。而且，现在我们可以看到线性段非常短而抛物线
for the linear segment. And, now we can see linear segment's quite short and the parabolic

42
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:04,029
混合物更长。线性段速度的可行值范围是
blends are longer. The range of feasible values for the velocity of the linear segment are

43
00:04:04,029 --> 00:04:10,689
实际上非常有限。并且，如果我建议值为0.02，则返回错误指示
actually quite limited. And, if I suggest a value of 0.02, it is returning an error indicating

44
00:04:10,689 --> 00:04:16,570
我指定的速度太小了。计算梯形是不可能的
that the velocity that I specified is too small. It's not possible to compute a trapezoidal

45
00:04:16,570 --> 00:04:21,239
具有该线性段的速度值的轮廓。
profile with that value of velocity for the linear segment.
