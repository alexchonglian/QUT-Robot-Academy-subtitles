1
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:07,319
现在我们将考虑相机正在观察一堆点和这些点的情况
Now we will consider the case where a camera is looking at a bunch of points and these

2
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:12,480
所有点都在飞机上。飞机有自己的坐标系，我们用它来表示
points all lie on a plane. The plane has got its own coordinate system which we denote

3
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,250
通过坐标框架零。显然，这个平面上的每个点都有一个Z坐标
by coordinate frame zero. Clearly every point that lies on this plane has got a Z coordinate

4
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:23,880
零，这在这里显示。坐标大写Z乘以所有元素
of zero, which is shown down here. The coordinate capital Z multiples all of the elements in

5
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,859
我们的相机矩阵的第三列，但因为它是零，我们可以有效地删除
the third column of our camera matrix but because it's zero we can effectively remove

6
00:00:28,859 --> 00:00:34,649
矩阵中的那一列，我们可以从世界坐标向量中删除该行。
that column from the matrix and we can remove that row from the world coordinate vector.

7
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:39,770
我们现在剩下的是一个三乘三矩阵，我们将这三个三个参考
What we're left with now is a three by three matrix and we'll refer to this three by three

8
00:00:39,770 --> 00:00:42,750
矩阵作为“平面同构”。
matrix as a "Planar Homography".

9
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:47,879
就像相机矩阵一样，有一个任意比例因子，我们可以再次
Just as for the camera matrix, there is an arbitrary scale factor and once again we can

10
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,270
通过选择我们要去的一个特定元素来标准化单应矩阵
normalize the homography matrix by choosing one particular element that we're going to

11
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:57,850
设置为值1。所以这三个三个矩阵，我们有一个元素
set to the value of one. So this three by three matrix, it's got one element that we've

12
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:03,090
设置为1，单应矩阵中剩余8个唯一数字。和我们
set to one, there are eight unique numbers remaining in the homography matrix. And we

13
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:09,380
如果我们有四个世界点和相应的位置，则可以估计单应矩阵
can estimate the homography matrix if we have four world points and the corresponding position

14
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:13,080
这些点在我们相机的图像平面上。
of those points on the image plane of our camera.

15
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:18,299
所以对应点的概念，想象我有两架飞机，其中一架也许是
So the concept of corresponding points, imagine that I've got two planes, one is perhaps the

16
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:22,380
相机的图像平面，另一个可能是世界上的物理平面那个
image plane of the camera, the other might be a physical plane in the world that the

17
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:28,460
相机正在看着。或者，第一个可以是世界上飞机的视图
camera is looking at. Alternatively the first could be a view of a plane in the world and

18
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:33,710
第二幅图像可能是世界上同一平面的另一个视图，我们已经移动了
the second image could be another view of the same plane in the world, where we've moved

19
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:35,680
两个视图之间的摄像头。
the camera between the two views.

20
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:41,290
现在我们在每个飞机上都有四个点，我将用下标来表示
Now we've got four points in each of these planes, which I'm going to denote by the subscripts

21
00:01:41,290 --> 00:01:45,860
一到四，我打算将这些点的坐标安排到
one through four and I'm going to arrange the coordinates of those points into the

22
00:01:45,860 --> 00:01:51,720
矩阵的列。但是这里真正重要的是这些列的排序。我们
columns of a matrix. But what's really important here is the ordering of these columns. We

23
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:58,040
必须确保所谓的通信。P1和Q1必须对应于同一点
have to ensure what's called correspondence. P1 and Q1 must correspond to the same point

24
00:01:58,040 --> 00:02:04,939
在世界上，它适用于P2，P3和P4。每个点P和对应点
in the world and so it goes for P2, P3 and P4. Each point P and the corresponding point

25
00:02:04,939 --> 00:02:08,800
Q必须指向世界上的同一点。
Q must refer to the same point in the world.

26
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,450
让我们看看如何使用这种技术来执行某些操作的实际示例
Let's look at a practical example of how we can use this technique to perform something

27
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:17,220
称为“透视矫正”。现在这是我拍摄的巴黎圣母院的照片
called "Perspective Rectification". Now this is a picture that I took of the Notre Dame

28
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:19,239
在巴黎的大教堂。
Cathedral in Paris.

29
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:23,760
这是一个非常高的大教堂，所以我在前面的地面上，仰视并拍照。
It's a very tall cathedral, so I'm on the ground in front, looking up and taking a picture.

30
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,629
很明显，因为我的相机向上倾斜，我的前方视野非常扭曲
And clearly because my camera is tilted upwards I've got a very distorted view of the front

31
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:33,060
大教堂但我知道有关大教堂的一些事情，特别是我知道
of the cathedral. But I know some things about cathedrals and particularly I know that the

32
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,550
大教堂前面最有可能是一架飞机。
front of the cathedral is most likely to be a plane.

33
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:41,489
因此，如果我在大教堂前面选择四个点，我相信所有这些都在一个单一的位置
So if I pick four points on the front of the cathedral that I believe all lie in a single

34
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:48,670
我可以将它们标记为P1到P4。但我知道那些点在非扭曲
plane and I can label them P1 through to P4. But I know that those points in a non-distorted

35
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:54,860
图像将在图像平面中形成一个矩形，而不是一个梯形。我可以计算图像平面
image will form a rectangle in the image plane, not a trapezoid. I can compute the image plane

36
00:02:54,860 --> 00:03:02,099
坐标Q1，Q2，Q3和Q4，以便在图像中有一个矩形。所以，如果我有
coordinates Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 in order to have a rectangle in the image. So if I have

37
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:08,590
现在有两套对应点;我有积分P1到P4，我有积分
now two sets of corresponding points; I have the points P1 through P4 and I have the points

38
00:03:08,590 --> 00:03:12,569
从Q1到Q4，我可以计算出单应性。
Q1 through Q4, then I can compute a homography.

39
00:03:12,569 --> 00:03:18,620
因此，如果我建立一个矩阵P，其中包含点P1到P4和列的列
So if I build up a matrix P that contains as columns the points P1 through P4 and the

40
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:25,799
矩阵Q，其列是Q1到Q4的点，然后我可以计算单应性。
matrix Q, whose columns are the points Q1 through Q4, then I can compute a homography.

41
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:30,580
它在这里显示，在MATLAB中非常简单。现在我有了这个单应性
And it's shown here and very simple to do in MATLAB. Now that I have this homography

42
00:03:30,580 --> 00:03:37,450
矩阵H，我可以用它来将我原始图像中的任何点P转换为任意点，Qin
matrix H, I can use it to transform any point, P, in my original image, to any point, Q in

43
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,290
第二张图片。
a second image.

44
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:43,909
这就是第二张图片的样子。我们看到大教堂已被拉直了
And this is what the second image looks like. We see that the cathedral has been straightened

45
00:03:43,909 --> 00:03:48,739
起来。我们可以看到大教堂的垂直边缘实际上是垂直线
up. We can see that the vertical edges of the cathedral are in fact vertical lines in

46
00:03:48,739 --> 00:03:52,879
图片。重要的是要记住，在这方面做出了非常强烈的假设
the image. It's important to remember that there's a very strong assumption made in this

47
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:57,640
这个过程就是图像中的所有点都在一个平面上。
process and that is that all of the points in the image lie on a plane.

48
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,599
当然，这张照片中的许多点都位于大教堂的正面，
Certainly many of the points in this image lay on the frontal plane of the cathedral,

49
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:08,269
但不是全部都这样做。如果我们看看这里的点，这些点位于钟楼的边缘，
but not all do. If we look at points around here, which are on the edges of the bell towers,

50
00:04:08,269 --> 00:04:13,580
那么他们就不会躺在正面上而且转型也不正确
then they do not lay on the frontal plane and the transformation won't be correct for

51
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:18,120
他们。它会在图像的那一部分引入失真。你无法得到任何东西
them. It will introduce a distortion in that part of the image. You can't get anything

52
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,860
免费，我们当然证明了大教堂的几何正确性。
for free, we've certainly proved that geometric correctness of the bulk of the cathedral.

53
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:28,139
鉴于我使用MATLAB计算了矩阵H，那么这是一个非常简单的问题
Given that I've computed the matrix H using MATLAB, then it's a very simple matter to

54
00:04:28,139 --> 00:04:34,720
将单应性应用于图像中的每个点。我们通过一个过程来执行
apply the homography to every single point in the image. And we perform that by a process

55
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,270
被称为“形象翘曲”。
known as "Image Warping".

56
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:43,290
要做图像变形，我们可以看到输出图像和输出中的每个像素
To do image warping, we can see that every single pixel in the output image and the output

57
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:49,240
在这种情况下，图像是几何校正的，大教堂的矫正图像。
image in this case is the geometrically correct, the rectified image of the cathedral.

58
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,750
为了说明这一点，我将在输出图像中选择一个特定点
To illustrate this I’m going to choose just one particular point in the output image and

59
00:04:54,750 --> 00:05:01,330
它是坐标600,100处的像素。现在，如果我知道像素坐标，我想
it’s the pixel at coordinate 600,100. Now if I know that pixel coordinate, I want to

60
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:06,110
尝试找出输入图像中相应的像素坐标。
try and work out what's the corresponding pixel coordinate in the input image.

61
00:05:06,110 --> 00:05:11,280
单应性是从原始图像到新图像的映射，因此为了映射
The homography is a mapping from the original image to the new image, so in order to map

62
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:16,180
这个坐标我需要使用单应性的逆，这给了我坐标
this coordinate I need to use the inverse of the homography and that gives me the coordinate

63
00:05:16,180 --> 00:05:23,630
在输入图像中的对应点，它的坐标为757和51。
of the corresponding point in the input image and it's got a coordinate of 757 and 51.

64
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:31,310
然后，图像变形的工作方式是在坐标757,51处找到像素
The way image warping works then is we go and find the pixel at coordinate 757, 51

65
00:05:31,310 --> 00:05:36,780
我们取这个像素值，然后将它插入到坐标600处的新图像中，
and we take that pixel value and we insert it into the new image at coordinate 600,

66
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:44,090
因此，对于输出图像中的每个像素，我们计算出来自哪里
100. So for every single pixel in the output image, we work out where it comes from in

67
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:45,770
输入图像。
the input image.

68
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:50,949
您可以在此处看到输入图像中的坐标是小数且需要的
You can see here that the coordinates in the input image are fractional and that requires

69
00:05:50,949 --> 00:05:56,530
一种称为图像插值的技术，用于查找此处的实际像素值
a technique called image interpolation to find what is the actual pixel value at this

70
00:05:56,530 --> 00:06:02,449
特定的分数坐标。简而言之，这是图像变形的过程。
particular fractional coordinate. In a nutshell, that's the process of image warping.

71
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:08,199
图像变形的另一个应用是现在在游泳电视广播中经常使用的效果，
Another application of image warping is this often used effect now in swimming telecasts,

72
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:14,400
我们拿旗帜和竞争对手的名字，我们将它们叠加在车道上
where we take the flag and the name of the competitors and we overlay them on the lanes

73
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:19,330
游泳池。这实际上是一个很容易的技巧，它涉及到这些
of the swimming pool. It's actually quite an easy trick to do and it involves these

74
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,190
单应性。
homographies.

75
00:06:20,190 --> 00:06:24,620
现在形象我可以游得很好，足以进入游泳比赛，所以有
Now image that I could swim well, well enough to get into a swimming tournament, so there's

76
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:29,430
我的国旗，这是我的名字。现在我有了这个我创建的图像，只是使用普通的
my flag and there's my name. Now I've got this image that I created, just using ordinary

77
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:34,699
计算机图形学，这很容易。现在我想把那张照片放在我的车道上
computer graphics, that's the easy bit. Now I want to lay that image into my lane in the

78
00:06:34,699 --> 00:06:40,259
游泳池。我需要做的就是找到四个相应的点，所以
swimming pool. All I need to do that, is to find the four corresponding points, so the

79
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:44,840
这个矩形的四个角，用于保存我想要叠加的图像和四个
four corners of this rectangle that holds the image that I want to overlay and the four

80
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,740
在游泳池里，我希望它被放置。
points in the swimming pool where I'd like it to be laid.

81
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:55,160
一旦我掌握了这些信息，我就可以将原始图像扭曲成这个非常扭曲的图像
Once I have that information I can warp that original image into this very distorted image

82
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:02,180
然后我可以插入或叠加到游泳池的原始图像上。
which I could then insert into or overlay onto the original image of the swimming pool.

83
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:06,940
那些正在做与该课程相关的项目的人，单应性正在进行中
Those of you who are doing the project associated with this course, the homography is going

84
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:12,310
非常非常有用。你可能已经建立了一个二维机器人，坐在上面
to be very, very useful. You've probably already built a two dimensional robot, that sits on

85
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:18,520
工作表，可以将其末端效应器移动到机器人上的任何特定XY坐标
a worksheet and can move its end effector to any particular XY coordinate on the robot

86
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:19,289
工作表。
worksheet.

87
00:07:19,289 --> 00:07:25,690
现在我们拍摄机器人工作表的照片。我有机器人工作表的图像。
Now image that we take a picture of that robot worksheet. I have an image of the robot worksheet.

88
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:30,460
单应性让我在工作表的图像中创建一个坐标，
The homography lets me create a mapping between a coordinate in the image of the worksheet,

89
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:36,569
在图像平面上有一个U，V的坐标，我可以将它映射到一个物理
which has got a coordinate of U,V in the image plane and I can map that to a physical

90
00:07:36,569 --> 00:07:42,930
机器人工作表上的坐标X，Y。我可以从图像平面坐标映射
coordinate, X,Y on the robot's worksheet. I can map from an image plane coordinate

91
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:48,190
到机器人工作表坐标，或者我可以从机器人工作表坐标向后映射
to a robot worksheet coordinate, or I can map from a robot worksheet coordinate back

92
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:51,030
到相机图像坐标。
to a camera image coordinate.

93
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:55,889
现在单应性对你完成项目非常非常有帮助。
Now homography's are going to be very, very helpful for you in completing the project.

94
00:07:55,889 --> 00:08:02,470
只是总结工具箱中用于计算和使用单应性的功能。特定
Just to summaries the capability in the toolbox for computing and using homographies. Given

95
00:08:02,470 --> 00:08:07,919
两组对应点P和Q，我们可以计算出三乘三的单应性
two sets of corresponding points P and Q, we can compute a three by three homography

96
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:15,310
矩阵。P和Q的列代表点。现在P可能是已知的图像坐标
matrix. The columns of P and Q represent points. Now P might be image coordinates of known

97
00:08:15,310 --> 00:08:22,110
在图像中的点，Q可能是机器人物理工作表上的点的坐标。
points in an image, Q might be coordinates of points on the robot's physical worksheet.

98
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:28,220
或者，P可以是一个图像中的一组图像坐标，Q可以是一组图像
Alternatively P could be a set of image coordinates in one image and Q could be a set of image

99
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:33,400
坐标在另一个图像。鉴于我有三乘三的单应矩阵
coordinates in another image. Given that I have the three by three homography matrix

100
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:41,400
然后，我可以在第一平面中将一组点P映射到第二平面中的一组点Q.
H, I can then map a set of points P, in the first plane, to a set of points Q, in the second plane.
