1
00:00:03,740 --> 00:00:08,300
让我们在MATLAB中演示一些这些原理。我要创造一个点
Let’s demonstrate some of these principles in MATLAB. I’m going to create a point in

2
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:15,309
世界它将在0.3米的X方向上坐标0.2米处
the world and it’s going to be at coordinate 0.2 meters in the X direction 0.3 meters in

3
00:00:15,309 --> 00:00:21,580
Y方向，Z方向5米。现在Z是方向
the Y direction and it’s going to be 5 meters in Z direction. Now Z is the direction along

4
00:00:21,580 --> 00:00:26,960
相机的轴我们称之为相机的光轴。这是一个相对较小的
the axis of a camera we call the optical axis of the camera. This is a relatively small

5
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:33,120
物体距离相机5米，世界点始终是列矢量
object five meters away from the camera and a world point is always a column vector so

6
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:34,050
它就是。
there it is.

7
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,870
现在我要创建一个相机对象实际上是一个中心相机对象
Now I’m going to create a camera object in fact a central camera object which does

8
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:45,410
我们刚学到的特定投影，它的焦距为8
the particular projection that we just learned about and it’s got a focal length of eight

9
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,370
毫米。
millimetres.

10
00:00:47,370 --> 00:00:54,629
所以在这里我们创建了一个工作区，现在是一个中央摄这个对象有
So here we created the workspace now a central camera projection object. This object has

11
00:00:54,629 --> 00:00:59,070
有很多方法，我们将看看其中一些。但首先我是
got quite a lot of methods and we’ll have a look at some of those. But first thing I’m

12
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,900
要做的就是使用这个相机对象，我将投射我的世界点资本
going to do is to use this camera object and I’m going to project my world point capital

13
00:01:04,900 --> 00:01:10,170
P到图像平面，你在这里看到的是我们有一些非常小的数字。
P to the image plane, what you see here is that we have got some very small numbers.

14
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:14,930
这些数字不到半毫米。我们已经看到了世界，我们已经看到了
These numbers are less than half a millimetre. We've taken our view of the world and we've

15
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:19,540
使它变得更小，更小并将其投影到图像平面上。这是件
made it much, much smaller and projected it onto the image plane. This is where the piece

16
00:01:19,540 --> 00:01:25,400
电影将是或者这是数码相机芯片的所在。在这个投影中有
of film would be or this is where the digital camera chip would be. In this projection there’s

17
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,619
没有像素的概念，我们刚刚拍摄了世界上的图像，并用术语描述
no notion of pixels we've just taken image in the world and it’s described in terms

18
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:35,220
尺寸和距离以米为单位。我们已将它投影到图像平面和
of size and its distance in units of meters. We've projected it to the image plane and

19
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:40,930
这也是以米为单位谈论图像的大小;极少数米。
this is talking about the size of the image also in units of meters; a very small number of meters.

20
00:01:41,670 --> 00:01:45,479
现在让我们把它变成数码相机让我们介绍像素的概念。我们
Now let’s turn this into a digital camera let’s introduce the notion of pixels. We’re

21
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:51,649
要创建一个新的相机对象。基本上回收这条线，我们会告诉它
going to create a new camera object. Basically recycle this line and we will tell it that

22
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:58,079
像素在一侧是10微米，因此像素是十微米宽十微米
the pixels are ten microns on a side so the pixels are square ten microns wide ten microns

23
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:05,229
高。他们的图像平面的分辨率为一千二十四平方。这个
high. And their image plane has got a resolution of one thousand and twenty four square. This

24
00:02:05,229 --> 00:02:07,840
是一款百万像素摄像头。
is a mega pixel camera.

25
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,560
现在，如果我们看一下相机对象的参数，我们在这里可以看到焦距。
Now if we look at the parameters of our camera object we see here we can see the focal length.

26
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,310
在这里我们可以看到像素的大小，像素数，1024x1024正是我们输入的内容
Here we can see the size of pixels, the number of pixels, 1024 x 1024 exactly what we entered

27
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:24,610
在命令行上。而这个参数是光学所在的主要点
on the command line. And this parameter the principal point which is where the optical

28
00:02:24,610 --> 00:02:30,739
穿过图像平面的轴在坐标512,512处的中间处被击打。
axis pierces the image plane is smack in the middle at coordinate 512, 512.

29
00:02:30,739 --> 00:02:36,190
现在我有了我的数码相机对象，我们可以重新进行之前的投影
Now that I have my digital camera object, we can re do that projection that we had before

30
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:43,080
项目到世界点P，现在这是以像素为单位的那个点的坐标。
project to world point P and this now is the coordinate of that point in units of pixels.

31
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:50,239
相机对象的另一种方法是在图形图像平面上实际绘制这些方法
Another method of the camera object is to actually plot these on a graphical image plane

32
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:56,250
在这里，我们可以看到数码相机上投影世界点的位置
and here we can see where that world point has been projected to on the digital cameras

33
00:02:56,250 --> 00:03:02,769
图像平面。所以现在我们可以看一下相机内在参数的方法。现在这个
image plane. So now the methods we can look at the cameras intrinsic parameters. Now this

34
00:03:02,769 --> 00:03:08,519
是内在参数矩阵;这是整个相机投影矩阵。我们可以
is the intrinsic parameter matrix; this is the overall camera projection matrix. We can

35
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:13,580
将附加选项传递给项目函数。
pass an additional option into the project function.

36
00:03:13,580 --> 00:03:18,370
第一个论点是我们的世界观点，现在我要稍微改变相机
First argument again is our world point and now I’m going to shift the camera a little

37
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:24,180
位。现在我要告诉它将摄像机沿X方向移动0.1米
bit. Now I’m going to tell it to shift the camera 0.1 meters in the X direction given

38
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,129
相机的坐标框架向右移动0.1米。不去
the camera’s coordinate frame that’s a shift of 0.1 meters to the right. Not going

39
00:03:29,129 --> 00:03:35,629
在Y方向或Z方向上移动它，所以我们现在看到的是投影
to move it in the Y or in the Z directions so now what we see is that the projection

40
00:03:35,629 --> 00:03:40,110
是不同的。我们希望，我们看到U坐标已经减少了
is different. And we would expect that, we see that the U coordinate has been reduced

41
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:46,709
从544到528，如果我们将相机向右移动，那就是我们所期望的
from 544 to 528 and that’s what we would expect if we move the camera to the right

42
00:03:46,709 --> 00:03:52,420
我们希望图像平面坐标向左移动一点。
we would expect the image plane coordinate to move a bit to the left.

43
00:03:52,420 --> 00:03:58,099
我们可以旋转相机，而不是翻译相机，以便我们可以旋转相机
Instead of translating the camera we could rotate the camera so we can rotate the camera

44
00:03:58,099 --> 00:04:06,120
围绕Y轴。现在Y轴指向下方，所以如果我做这个0.1弧度的旋转
around the Y axis. Now the Y axis points downwards so if I do this rotation of 0.1 radians around

45
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:12,950
Y轴实际上是向右旋转相机，如果我们这样做的话
the Y axis that’s essentially rotating the camera towards the right and if we do that

46
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:18,130
这是投影再次，正如我所期望的那样，如果我将相机旋转一点
here’s the projection again and as we would expect if I rotate the camera a bit towards

47
00:04:18,130 --> 00:04:24,740
右侧图像中的像素将在图像平面上向左移动一点。
the right the pixel in the image will move a bit towards the left on the image plane.

48
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:29,840
让我们考虑一个更复杂的例子，一个世界上有多个点的例子。
Let’s consider a more complex example, one where there are multiple points in the world.

49
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,150
要在网格模式中创建多个点，我现在将使用工具箱功能
To create multiple points in a grid pattern now I’m going to use the toolbox function

50
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:43,680
mkgrid，我想要一个2x2网格，点数在0.2米中心间隔，我想要
mkgrid and I want a 2x2 grid and the points spaced on 0.2 metre centres and I want the

51
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:52,160
网格的中心位于坐标1,2,0处。所以这是XY平面中的网格，
centre of the grid to be at a coordinate 1, 2, 0. So this is a grid in the XY plane, the

52
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,970
网格中心在X方向偏移1米，在Y方向偏移2米
centre of the grid is offset 1 metre in the X direction and 2 metres in the Y direction

53
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,820
并且所有点的Z坐标都为零。
and all the points have got a Z coordinate of zero.

54
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:06,520
所以这里是我刚刚创建的一组点，以便查看这四点
So here are the set of points that I have just created in order to view these four points

55
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:13,090
它躺在地平面上我要创造一个新的相机。这是一个中心投影
which lie on a ground plane I’m going to create a new camera. It’s a central projection

56
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:18,449
再次模型相机。我将设置默认摄像头参数，因此这是默认值
model camera again. I’m going to set default camera parameters so this is default values

57
00:05:18,449 --> 00:05:25,300
用于焦距图像平面尺寸和像素尺寸。我要明确地给出姿势
for focal length image plane size and pixel size. I’m going to explicitly give the pose

58
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,669
相机的所以我们的四个点都躺在地面上，以便我的相机
of the camera so our four points are lying on the ground plane so in order for my camera

59
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:35,340
为了能够看到它们，它需要在一个向上俯视的地方，所以第一件事就是这样
to be able to see them it needs to be somewhere up high looking down so the first thing that

60
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:41,169
我要做的是将相机放在地面以上4米处。所以这是一个翻译
I’m going to do is to place the camera 4 metres above the ground. So this is a translation

61
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:48,470
沿着正Z轴4米，然后我将围绕Z旋转它
of 4 metres along the positive Z axis and then I’m going to rotate it around the Z

62
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:57,630
轴由Pi/3弧度组成，然后我将围绕Y轴旋转相机
axis by Pi/3 radians and then I’m going to rotate the camera around the Y axis

63
00:05:57,630 --> 00:05:59,120
所以它指向地面。
so it points down at the ground.

64
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:04,780
所以只需用π弧度围绕Y轴旋转它。和我在一起，我会用这个例子
So just rotate it around the Y axis by pi radians. Bare with me I’ll work this example

65
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,569
这些数字应该给出类似正确的结果。
out and these numbers should give something like the right result.

66
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:13,539
我们要做的第一件事就是将这4个世界点投射到相机的图像上
First thing we’re going to do is to project those 4 world points onto the camera’s image

67
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:19,330
飞机，这里我们有这些点的坐标。所以他们显然是在内
plane and here we have the coordinates of those points. So they clearly lay within the

68
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:24,800
视野，我们实际上可以看看这四点。我们可以策划那些
field of view and we can actually have a look at those four points. And we can plot those

69
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:28,960
这就是图像平面的样子。所以他们只是在场上的边缘
and that’s what the image plane looks like. So they’re just in the edge of the field

70
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,169
看着我们的相机，往下看。
of view of our camera, which is looking down.

71
00:06:32,169 --> 00:06:36,180
现在让我们尝试3D了解这里发生了什么，所以我要去
Now let’s try and get a 3D understanding of what’s going on here so I’m going to

72
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,039
创造一个新的人物。我将把它称为图二和相机上的另一种方法
create a new figure. I’m going to call it figure two and another method on the camera

73
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,660
我们刚创建的对象称为绘图相机。是什么让它成为3D模型
object we just created is called plot camera. What that does it to render it’s a 3D model

74
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:52,520
将相机变成图形，我要做的另一件事是添加到这些中
of a camera into a graphic and the other thing that I’m going to do is to add to these

75
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:58,120
图4给出了我的资本P的4个世界点我将把它们变成小点
graphic the 4 world points given my capital P I’m going to render them as the little

76
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:05,250
半径为0.5米的球体创造了这个小场景，打开网格
spheres with a radius of 0.5 meters each so created this little scene, turn the grid on

77
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:06,580
让它更容易看到。
to make it a bit easier to see.

78
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:13,080
如果我打开我的3D旋转工具，我可以旋转它。在这里，我们可以看到它的外观
If I turn on my 3D rotation tool I can spin this around. Here we can see what it looks

79
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:18,280
比如，这里是地平面上的四个点，然后我使用网格函数创建。
like, here are the four points on the ground plane now then I created using the grid function.

80
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:22,280
在顶部我们可以看到相机，我们可以看到相机的轴。相机是
And up the top we can see the camera and we can see the axis of the camera. Camera is

81
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:27,860
有点小。我们可以放大并查看相机，有我们
a little bit small. We can zoom in and have a look at the camera there is it, there we

82
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:34,919
可以看到它的x，y和z轴，也许放大一点，我们可以看到它，它
can see its x, y and z axis, zoom in a little bit more perhaps and we can see there, it

83
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:41,380
看起来有点像相机。这是一个正面有圆柱的盒子。这些是
looks a little bit like a camera. It’s a box with a cylinder on the front. These are

84
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:47,770
只是使用相机类中可以做的很多事情的几个例子
just the few examples of the many things that you can do using the camera classes within

85
00:07:47,770 --> 00:07:48,669
工具箱。
the toolbox.
