00:00:04,049 --> 00:00:07,379
让我们总结一下我们在本讲座中学到的东西。
Let’s summarise what we have learned in this lecture.

2
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:13,800
MATLAB支持矩阵和标量，矩阵和矩阵之间的许多操作。
MATLAB supports a number of operations between matrices and scalars, and matrices and matrices.

3
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:20,439
在矩阵和标量的情况下，会发生的是标量应用于每个标量
In the case of a matrix and a scalar, what happens is that the scalar is applied to every

4
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:25,619
输入矩阵的元素和那些结果被放入相应的元素中
element of the input matrix and those results are placed into the corresponding elements

5
00:00:25,619 --> 00:00:27,630
输出矩阵
of the output matrix.

6
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,730
我们可以在矩阵和标量之间使用的各种运算符包括标准
The sorts of operators we can use between a matrix and a scalar include the standard

7
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:37,480
算术运算符，它们还包括逻辑运算符，它们执行逻辑运算
arithmetic operators and they also include the logical operators, which perform logical

8
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:41,800
比较，其结果是假的。
comparisons, and which have a result which is either true of false.

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:46,430
当我们在矩阵和矩阵之间执行操作时，矩阵需要是
When we perform an operation between a matrix and a matrix, the matrices need to be the

10
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:52,260
相同的大小和操作在矩阵的相应元素之间执行。
same size and the operations are performed between corresponding elements of the matrix.

11
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,969
结果被放入输出矩阵的相应元素中。
Results are placed into the corresponding element of the output matrix.

12
00:00:57,969 --> 00:01:00,739
MATLAB支持许多逻辑运算符。
MATLAB supports a number of logical operators.

13
00:01:00,739 --> 00:01:07,500
逻辑运算符的结果只是真或假，我们可以执行许多不同的结果
The results of logical operator are only true or false and we can perform a number of different

14
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:14,390
逻辑测试：平等;非平等;比...更棒;少于;等等。
logical tests: equality; non-equality; greater than; less than; and so on.

15
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:19,550
我们已经谈到了monadic图像处理，这就是单个像素的位置
We have talked about monadic image processing and that is where individual pixels in the

16
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:25,470
输入图像通过函数f（x）传递，结果放入相应的
input image are passed through a function f(x) and the result is placed into the corresponding

17
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:29,030
输出矩阵中的元素。
element in the output matrix.

18
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:33,920
我们对所有像素应用相同的函数，我们查看了许多操作，例如
We apply the same function to all pixels and we looked at a number of operations such as

19
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,170
对比;增强;亮度变化;直方图归一化;阈值;色调分离;
contrast; enhancement; brightness change; histogram normalization; thresholding; posterization;

20
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:40,220
等等。
and so on.

21
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,390
而且还有很多很多。
And there are many, many, more.

22
00:01:43,390 --> 00:01:47,840
我们所看到的另一类操作就是我们所说的diadic操作
The other class of operation we looked at are what we called diadic operations and here

23
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,310
我们有两个输入图像，通过一个函数并输出值
we have two input images, passed through a function and the output value is placed into

24
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,920
输出图像中的相应像素。
the corresponding pixel in the output image.

25
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:01,090
diadic操作的一些例子是图像减法，我们用它来找到差异
Some examples of diadic operations were image subtraction, which we used to find the difference

26
00:02:01,090 --> 00:02:02,960
在两个输入场景之间。
between two input scenes.

27
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,260
我们还使用了不同的diadic操作的数量来执行相当复杂的操作
We also used the number of different diadic operations in performing quite a sophisticated

28
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,250
图像处理任务，即实现绿屏效果。
image processing task, which is implementing the green screen effect.
