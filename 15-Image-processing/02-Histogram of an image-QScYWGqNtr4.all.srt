00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:09,299
描述图像中灰度级的一种非常有用和简洁的方法是使用a
A very useful and concise way of describing the grey levels within an image is using a

2
00:00:09,299 --> 00:00:13,830
工具称为直方图。在这里，我有一个人为的低分辨率
tool called a histogram. Here I have a contrived and low resolution

3
00:00:13,830 --> 00:00:21,140
图像，其中像素灰度值在0（黑色）和10（白色）之间变化。
image, where the pixel grey values vary between 0, which is black, and 10, which is white.

4
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:25,350
我们可以将直方图过程视为排序过程。我要去拿
We can consider the histogramming process as a sorting process. I am going to take the

5
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:29,849
第一个像素，其灰度值为6，我将把它放入垃圾箱
first pixel, which has got a grey scale value of 6, and I am going to drop it into the bin

6
00:00:29,849 --> 00:00:34,370
对于值为6的像素。我将采用下一个有值的像素
for pixels with a value of 6. And I am going to take the next pixel which has got a value

7
00:00:34,370 --> 00:00:38,650
10，我打算将它放入bin中，以获得值为10的像素，依此类推。
of 10, and I am going to drop it into the bin for pixels of value of 10, and so on.

8
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:42,370
我们一直重复这个过程，直到我们为其中的所有像素着色
And we repeat this process on and on until we have coloured all of the pixels in the

9
00:00:42,370 --> 00:00:46,140
图片。我们有这个直方图。一目了然
image. And we have this histogram. At a glance this

10
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:50,330
直方图告诉我们关于图像的一些非常有趣的事情。如果所有像素都是
histogram tells us some very interesting things about the image. If all of the pixels are

11
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:56,049
在直方图的左侧，这告诉我们它是一个非常暗的图像。反过来，
at the left-hand side of the histogram, this tells us that it is a very dark image. Conversely,

12
00:00:56,049 --> 00:00:59,089
如果所有像素都在直方图的右侧，这告诉我们
if all of the pixels are at the right-hand side of the histogram, this tells us that

13
00:00:59,089 --> 00:01:04,559
这是一个非常明亮的形象。您很可能遇到直方图。
it is a very bright image. You have very likely encountered histograms.

14
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:10,420
它们通常显示在相机的取景器中。我们在这里看到的是
They are commonly displayed in the viewfinder of a camera. What we are seeing here is the

15
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:16,100
iPhone相机应用程序的取景器，我们可以在显示屏上看到直方图。
viewfinder of an iPhone camera app and we can see the histogram here on the display.

16
00:01:16,100 --> 00:01:19,930
直方图的左侧对应于暗像素，右侧对应于右侧
The left-hand side of the histogram corresponds to the dark pixels, and the right-hand side

17
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:25,860
直方图的对应于亮像素。如果我将相机从此视图移动到下方
of the histogram corresponds to bright pixels. If I move the camera from this view to down

18
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,460
在我的办公桌下面，一切都很暗，我们可以看到有越来越多的人
underneath my desk where it is all very dark, we can see that there are an increasing number

19
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:34,310
场景中的暗像素。当我从桌子下面拿起相机并指出时
of dark pixels in the scene. As I bring the camera up from underneath the desk and point

20
00:01:34,310 --> 00:01:38,110
它在窗外非常明亮，我们看到像素的分布更加移动
it out the window where it is very bright, we see the distribution of pixels moving more

21
00:01:38,110 --> 00:01:42,590
朝着直方图的明亮端。如果我重复这个过程，但这次我有
towards the bright end of the histogram. If I repeat the process, but this time I have

22
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:48,640
相机设置为自动曝光控制，现在发生的是内部的软件
the camera set to automatic exposure control, what happens now is that the software within

23
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:53,390
相机试图保持直方图平衡。它试图保持均匀的混合
the camera is trying to keep the histogram balanced. It is trying to keep an even mixture

24
00:01:53,390 --> 00:01:58,010
暗像素和亮像素，使平均值位于中间的某个位置。和
of dark pixels and bright pixels, so that the average is somewhere in the middle. And

25
00:01:58,010 --> 00:02:01,860
这一次的行为是完全不同的，当我们在桌子底下看时，我们可以看到
the behaviour this time is quite different, when we look under the desk, we can see the

26
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:03,120
电线和地毯。
wires and the carpet.

27
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:09,820
当我们向窗外望去时，我们现在可以清楚地看到外面的世界。
When we look out the window, we can now quite clearly see the world outside.
