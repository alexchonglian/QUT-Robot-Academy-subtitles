1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,540
在上一课中，我们学习了如何将数字图像导入计算机，我们学到了很多东西
In the last lecture we learned how to import a digital image into a computer and we learned

2
00:00:07,550 --> 00:00:11,769
计算机内的图像只是一大堆数字。更确切地说，它是
that an image inside a computer is just a big bunch of numbers. More precisely it's

3
00:00:11,769 --> 00:00:17,650
一个矩形的数字数组，我们可以认为它是一个矩阵。现在得到图像
a rectangular array of numbers which we can consider to be a matrix. Now getting the image

4
00:00:17,650 --> 00:00:22,070
进入电脑只是第一步。我们需要以各种方式操纵这个图像
into the computer is just the first step. We need to manipulate this image in various

5
00:00:22,070 --> 00:00:27,550
方法，以便我们可以从该图像中提取足以提供的信息
ways so that we can extract the information from that image which is sufficient to hand

6
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:33,870
穿过一个机器人，让它完成它的工作。所以在这个讲座和下一个讲座中，我们都是
across to a robot to allow it to do its job. So in this lecture and the next one, we're

7
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,969
去了解一些转换图像的基本方法，以帮助我们
going to learn about some fundamental ways to transform images so as to help us in the

8
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:41,670
提取意义的过程。
process of extracting meaning.

9
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:47,480
这些技术属于一种称为图像处理的类别，这就是我们的方式
These techniques fall into a category which is called image processing, which is how we

10
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:53,310
拍摄一张图像并将其转换为不同的图像，这有助于我们完成提取任务
take one image and transform it into a different image which helps us in our task of extracting

11
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:57,850
那个意思。所以我们有兴趣考虑的各种转换
that meaning. So the sorts of transformations that we would be interested in considering

12
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:02,500
是;我们如何增强图像的对比度？我们如何降低分辨率
are; how do we enhance the contrast of an image? How do we reduce the resolution of

13
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,979
一个图像？我们如何突出显示图像中的水平线条或如何突出显示垂直线条
an image? How do we highlight horizontal lines in an image or how do we highlight vertical

14
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,770
图像中的线条？或者我们如何突出显示红色或绿色或者绿色的东西
lines in an image? Or how do we highlight things that are red or that are green or that

15
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:18,380
是蓝色的。所以这些是一些基本技术，可以帮助我们完成装备之旅
are blue. So these are some fundamental techniques that will help us in our journey of equipping

16
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,790
有远见的机器人。
robots with vision.
