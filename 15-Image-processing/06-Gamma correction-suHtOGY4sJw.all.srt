1
00:00:03,949 --> 00:00:08,290
另一个重要的monadic图像处理操作是伽马校正，我要去了
Another important monadic image processing operation is gamma correction, and I am going

2
00:00:08,290 --> 00:00:12,180
现在谈谈伽玛的问题。
to talk now about the problem of gamma.

3
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:17,320
早在电视的早期，选择的显示装置就是阴极射线
Back in the early days of television, the display device of choice was the cathode ray

4
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,910
管和阴极管是非常非线性的装置。
tube and the cathode tube is a very non-linear device.

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:25,970
所以对于输入电压V，屏幕上的亮度，我将称之为L
So for an input voltage V, the brightness on the screen, which I am going to call L

6
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:29,670
对于亮度，是输入电压的功率。
for luminance, was the power of the input voltage.

7
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:35,680
事实上，它几乎是一个平方定律，所以就是这样;屏幕上某点的亮度
In fact, it was almost a square law, so that is; the luminance of a point on the screen

8
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,800
大约是输入电压的平方-输入电压升至2.2的功率。
was about the square of the input voltage—the input voltage raised to the power of 2.2.

9
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,700
因此，这个数字2.2被称为显示设备的伽玛。
So this number, 2.2, is referred to as the gamma of the display device.

10
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,340
所以这有点困难。
So this is a bit of a difficulty.

11
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:55,810
输出亮度与输入电压不成线性比例。
The output luminance is not linearly proportional to the input voltage.

12
00:00:55,810 --> 00:00:58,280
现在让我们为系统添加一个摄像头。
Now let’s add a camera to the system.

13
00:00:58,280 --> 00:01:05,329
因此，相机看着世界，它看到亮度L，并将其转换为电压。
So the camera looks at the world and it sees luminance L and it converts that to a voltage.

14
00:01:05,329 --> 00:01:11,070
电压传输到电视接收器，电视接收器产生
The voltage is transmitted to the television receiver, and the television receiver produces

15
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:17,649
亮度，与输入电压升高到伽马功率有关。
a luminance, which is related to the input voltage raised to the power of gamma.

16
00:01:17,649 --> 00:01:22,229
现在发生的是我们的系统从头到尾不是线性的。
And what happens now is that our system is not linear from end to end.

17
00:01:22,229 --> 00:01:27,090
我在屏幕上看到的亮度是原始亮度提升到的功率
The luminance that I see on my screen is the original luminance raised to the power of

18
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,560
伽玛，这将对对比度产生非常糟糕的影响。
gamma, and that is going to have a really bad effect on contrast.

19
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:35,780
如果原始图像的一部分是我在屏幕上的另一部分亮度的两倍
If one part of the original image is twice as bright as another on the screen that I

20
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:41,579
我看着，它的亮度几乎会增加四倍。
am looking at, it will appear to be almost four times greater in brightness.

21
00:01:41,579 --> 00:01:46,439
因此，为了解决这个问题，早期的电视工程师提出了一个非常巧妙的技巧。
So to get around this problem the early television engineers pulled a pretty neat trick.

22
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:52,530
他们所做的是将相反的非线性插入相机：亮度
And what they did is they inserted the inverse non-linearity into the camera: the luminance

23
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,259
我在电视屏幕上看到的与电视场景的亮度成正比
that I see on my TV screen is proportional to the luminance of the scene that the TV

24
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:58,779
相机在看。
camera was looking at.

25
00:01:58,779 --> 00:02:01,610
现在系统从头到尾是线性的。
The system now is linear from end to end.

26
00:02:01,610 --> 00:02:04,880
这对于观看电视图像的人来说非常好。
And that is great for the person viewing the TV image.

27
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:10,720
因此，相机内的过程称为伽玛编码和之间的图像
So the process within the camera is referred to as gamma encoding and the image between

28
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:16,709
相机和电视屏幕被称为伽马编码图像。
the camera and the TV screen is referred to as a gamma encoded image.

29
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:22,269
伽玛解码的过程，或有时称为伽马校正，发生在
And the process of gamma decoding, or sometimes called gamma correction, happens within the

30
00:02:22,269 --> 00:02:24,769
显示屏。
display screen.

31
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:31,019
现在，这与今天相关的是那些伽马编码的图像是我们记录的
Now where this is relevant today is those gamma encoded images are what we record in

32
00:02:31,019 --> 00:02:32,019
图像文件。
image files.

33
00:02:32,019 --> 00:02:38,010
因此，如果我采用标准图像文件格式，JPEG文件或其他任何像素值
So if I take a standard image file format, a JPEG file or whatever, the pixel values

34
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:41,430
在该文件中已经过伽马编码。
within that file have been gamma encoded.

35
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:48,190
它们与相机正在观看的场景的亮度线性不相关。
They are not linearly related to the luminance of the scene that the camera is looking at.

36
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:53,640
在几乎任何图像文件格式的标题中都有一个条目，其中说：
And in the header of almost any image file format there is an entry there, which says:

37
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,000
什么是相机中使用的伽玛设置。
what’s the gamma setting that has been used in the camera.

38
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,109
即使阴极射线管早已消失，这仍然是方便的原因
The reason that this is still convenient even though cathode ray tubes have long gone is

39
00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:09,230
图像文件中的那些图像像素将显示在屏幕上，
that those image pixels in the image file are going to be displayed on your screen,

40
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:16,549
正如我之前所说，即使是现代的屏幕也能模仿旧的阴极射线管的非线性。
and as I said before even modern screens emulate the old cathode ray tube non-linearity.

41
00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:22,090
因此，记住图像文件中的像素值是非常重要的
So it is really important to remember that the pixel values within an image file are

42
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:26,000
与现实世界的亮度没有线性关系。
not linearly related to the real world luminance.

43
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:31,390
它们与亮度相关，相对于γ的功率为1;事实上，它几乎是
They are related to that luminance to the power of 1 over gamma; in fact, it is almost

44
00:03:31,390 --> 00:03:34,560
平方根函数。
a square root function.

45
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:40,019
所以我们可以进行伽马校正，我们可以将其视为一元函数。
So we can do gamma correction, we can treat that as a monadic function.

46
00:03:40,019 --> 00:03:45,099
该功能基本上是我们采用每个输入像素并将其提升到伽玛的功率。
The function is basically we take every input pixel and raise it to the power of gamma.

47
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:50,709
我们可以看到这种映射基本上是抛物线形状。
And we can see that there is basically a parabolic shape to this mapping.

48
00:03:50,709 --> 00:03:55,819
如果我们将它应用于图像并查看它，我们会发现图像看起来非常非常
And if we apply it to an image and look at it, we see that the image looks very, very

49
00:03:55,819 --> 00:03:57,019
确实很黑。
dark indeed.

50
00:03:57,019 --> 00:04:02,219
原因就是我所做的是伽马校正此图像两次。
And the reason for that is that what I have done is gamma corrected this image twice.

51
00:04:02,219 --> 00:04:08,359
我通过应用这个monadic函数，然后我的屏幕，伽马校正图像，
I have gamma corrected the image by applying this monadic function and then my screen,

52
00:04:08,359 --> 00:04:12,500
或者您的屏幕，再次应用了伽马校正。
or your screen, has applied the gamma correction again.

53
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:17,280
因此，如果您想要查看和操作，则应用伽马校正会很有用
So it can be useful to apply gamma correction if you want to look at and manipulate the

54
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,350
像素值，因为您希望它们与原始光照水平成比例
pixel values, because you want them to be proportional to the original light levels

55
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:28,440
在场景中，但在显示器上显示伽马校正图像并不是一件有用的事情
in the scene, but to display a gamma corrected image on a monitor is not a useful thing to

56
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:28,660
做。
do.
