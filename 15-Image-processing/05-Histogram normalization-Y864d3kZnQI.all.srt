00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:11,550
直方图归一化是一种常用技术，用于增强其中的细节
Histogram normalization is a common technique that is used to enhance fine detail within

2
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:13,740
一个图像。
an image.

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:19,449
从图像强度直方图计算累积直方图。
The cumulative histogram is computed from the image intensity histogram.

4
00:00:19,449 --> 00:00:26,640
累积直方图中的每列被计算为所有图像强度的总和
Each column in the cumulative histogram is computed as the sum of all the image intensity

5
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:33,190
直方图值高达并包括该灰度级，然后按比例缩放
histogram values up to and including that grey level, and then it is scaled so that

6
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,670
最终值为1.0。
the final value is 1.0.

7
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,950
你会注意到的累积直方图是它在非常陡峭的时候
And what you will notice with the cumulative histogram is that it is very steep when the

8
00:00:40,950 --> 00:00:47,350
输入直方图非常大，当输入直方图相当时它是相当平坦的
input histogram is quite large, and it is fairly flat when the input histogram is quite

9
00:00:47,350 --> 00:00:48,920
低。
low.

10
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:54,500
因此，我们可以在这里看到累积直方图快速增长的几个领域。
So we can see here a couple of areas where the cumulative histogram has grown quite quickly.

11
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:58,080
现在我们使用累积直方图作为映射。
Now we use the cumulative histogram as a mapping.

12
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:04,970
因此对于每个输入值，以及0到255范围内的这些无符号整数像素值，
So for every input value, and these unsigned integer pixel values in the range 0 to 255,

13
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:11,780
我取一个输入像素x，然后通过累积直方图对其进行映射，得到结果。
I take an input pixel x and I map it through the cumulative histogram and I get the result.

14
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:18,640
所以我的x函数是通过图像的累积直方图的非线性映射。
So my function of x is a non-linear mapping through the cumulative histogram of the image.

15
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:24,030
因此，蒙娜丽莎图像的结果是增强了许多细节。
So the result of this on the Mona Lisa image is to enhance a lot of the fine detail.

16
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:29,310
因此，如果我们看一下背景，我们可以看到它在相当暗的区域
So if we have a look into the background we can see areas where it is fairly dark in the

17
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:35,870
原始图像和直方图归一化增加了局部对比度;做好了
original image and where the histogram normalization has increased the local contrast; made it

18
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:41,110
我们可以看到细节，否则我们在输入中很难看到
possible for us to see detail that otherwise we could not see very easily in the input

19
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:42,350
图片。
image.

20
00:01:42,350 --> 00:01:46,260
这是monadic图像处理操作的另一个例子。
This is another example of a monadic image processing operation.
