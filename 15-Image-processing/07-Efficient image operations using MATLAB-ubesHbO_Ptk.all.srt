1
00:00:03,409 --> 00:00:08,540
想象一下，我们现在想要尝试实现其中一些monadic操作，比如添加
Imagine now that we want to try and implement some of these monadic operations, like adding

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:15,440
每个像素的常数，或每个像素乘以常数。
a constant to every pixel, or to multiply every pixel by a constant.

3
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,519
一种方法是编写一些带有一些嵌套循环的代码
One way to do this would be to write some code with some nested loops that step through

4
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:26,320
矩阵中的每个元素并对它们执行monadic操作。
every element in the matrix and performs the monadic operation on them.

5
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:31,140
在MATLAB中有一种简单的方法，它是MATLAB中的一种技术
In MATLAB there is an easy way to do it and it is a technique in MATLAB that is referred

6
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:34,830
作为矢量化。
to as vectorization.

7
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:41,340
考虑到我们有一个包含n行和m列的矩阵，我们有一个标量。
Consider that we have a matrix with n rows and m columns and we have a scalar.

8
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,870
在中间我们有许多标准算术运算符;加，减，次，
And in in the middle we have a number of standard arithmetic operators; plus, minus, times,

9
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:48,520
分裂等等。
divide and so on.

10
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:55,489
例如，如果我们使用加法运算符加符号-我们将矩阵添加到标量中，
If, for instance, we use the addition operator—plus symbol—and we add the matrix to a scalar,

11
00:00:55,489 --> 00:00:58,370
结果将是一个矩阵。
the result will be a matrix.

12
00:00:58,370 --> 00:01:04,039
MATLAB要做的是将标量添加到每个元素中
And what MATLAB is going to do is to add the scalar to every individual element of the

13
00:01:04,039 --> 00:01:09,660
输入矩阵并将其分配给输出矩阵中的相应元素。
input matrix and assign it to the corresponding element in the output matrix.

14
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:14,030
所以我们不必编写循环来将标量添加到每个元素中
So we do not have to write loops to go through and add the scalar to every element of the

15
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:15,430
输入矩阵。
input matrix.

16
00:01:15,430 --> 00:01:22,500
MATLAB将为我们做，我们使用矩阵运算符和标量的简写符号。
MATLAB will do it for us, and we use the short hand notation of a matrix operator and a scalar.

17
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:29,300
所以我们可以为每个元素矩阵添加一个常量，减去常量;乘;划分;
So we can add a constant to every element matrix, subtract the constant; multiply; divide;

18
00:01:29,300 --> 00:01:31,850
把每个元素都提升到一个力量;等等。
raise every element to a power; and so on.

19
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:35,330
我们现在将用一个真实的例子来证明这一点。
We are going to demonstrate this now with a real example.

20
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:41,960
我们将首先创建一个矩阵并将其命名为m，其元素将全部为整数，
We will start by creating a matrix and call it m, and its elements will all be integers,

21
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:44,480
1到10之间的整数。
integers between 1 and 10.

22
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,580
矩阵将是4乘4。
And the matrix will be 4 by 4.

23
00:01:47,580 --> 00:01:53,050
我们将使用MATLAB内置的randi函数来随机创建这个矩阵
We are going to use MATLAB’s built in randi function to create this matrix with random

24
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,970
其中的整数元素。
integer elements in it.

25
00:01:54,970 --> 00:02:01,069
现在我要向该矩阵添加1，或者添加一个矩阵-四乘四矩阵
Now I am going to add 1 to that matrix, or adding a matrix—four by four matrix—to

26
00:02:01,069 --> 00:02:08,349
一个标量，MATLAB要做的是为矩阵的每个元素加1。
a scalar, and what MATLAB is going to do is add 1 to every element of the matrix.

27
00:02:08,349 --> 00:02:16,520
同样，如果我将矩阵乘以2，我们将看到每个单独的元素
Similarly, if I multiply the matrix by 2, we will see that every individual element

28
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:21,230
在矩阵m中乘以2。
in the matrix m has been multiplied by 2.

29
00:02:21,230 --> 00:02:25,290
我们可以以类似的方式执行更复杂的数学函数。
We can perform more complex mathematical functions in a similar way.

30
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,300
我们可以计算m的平方根，MATLAB要做的是计算平方
We can compute the square root of m, and what MATLAB is going to do is to compute the square

31
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,860
矩阵中每个元素的根。
root of every element within the matrix.

32
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:40,280
最后，我们可以将矩阵的每个元素提升到2的幂，我们使用运算符
Finally, we can raise each element of the matrix to the power of two, we use the operator

33
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:47,720
。^我们在这里看到的是矩阵m中的每个元素都已被平方。
.^ and what we see here is that every element in the matrix m has been squared.

34
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:54,280
重要的是要注意这与写这个非常不同，这是做了什么的
Important to note that this is very different to writing this, and what this has done is

35
00:02:54,280 --> 00:03:00,200
将矩阵m乘以其自身;它和写那个一样。
to multiply the matrix m by itself; it is the same as writing that.

36
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:05,490
这是使用矩阵乘法规则将矩阵乘以矩阵-非常不同
This is multiplying a matrix by a matrix, using matrix multiplication rules — very different

37
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:09,760
将矩阵的每个元素提高到2的幂。
to raising each element of the matrix to the power of 2.
