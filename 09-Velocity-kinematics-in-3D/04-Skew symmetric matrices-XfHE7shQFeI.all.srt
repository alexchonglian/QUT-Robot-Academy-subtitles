00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:08,870
让我们快速介绍偏斜对称矩阵。这些矩阵有时被称为
Let’s do a quick introduction to skew symmetric matrices. These matrices are sometimes called

2
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:13,160
反对称矩阵，它们具有转置的有趣特性
anti-symmetric matrices and they have this interesting property that the transpose is

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,410
等于原始矩阵的负数。这些矩阵总是单一的。其
equal to the negative of the original matrix. These matrices are always singular. Their

4
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:23,650
行列式总是等于零。任何矩阵都是对称矩阵的总和
determinant is always equal to zero. Any matrix is the sum of a symmetric matrix

5
00:00:23,650 --> 00:00:30,099
和一个偏斜对称矩阵。在三维中，我们可以编写偏斜对称矩阵
and a skew symmetric matrix. In three dimensions, we can write the skew symmetric matrix which

6
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:35,300
以这种方式是三元素向量的函数。所以，我们有一个元素的向量
is a function of a three element vector in this fashion. So, we have a vector whose elements

7
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:40,460
是X，Y和Z.偏斜对称矩阵看起来像这样。显而易见的特征是
are X, Y, and Z. The skew symmetric matrix looks like this. The obvious features are

8
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:45,320
零的对角线。那里有两个X.两个Y和两个Z.其中一个有
a diagonal of zeros. There are two X's in there. Two Y's and two Z's. One of them has

9
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:49,170
一个积极的迹象，其中一个有负号。
a positive sign and one of them has a negative sign.

10
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,510
我们还可以将矢量叉积作为矩阵矢量积。其中一个矩阵
We can also write a vector cross product as a matrix vector product. One of the matrices

11
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,410
是从第一个向量计算的偏斜对称矩阵。
is a skew symmetric matrix computed from the first vector.

12
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,710
这是一个偏斜的对称矩阵，我将与你分享一些经验法则
Here’s a skew symmetric matrix and I am going share with you some rules of thumb for

13
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:07,390
你如何确定哪些元素是你写这个矩阵的地方。开始
how you work out which elements are where when you write this matrix down. To start

14
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:11,970
用，有一个零对角线。所以，这很容易。你写了三个零
with, there is a zero diagonal. So, that’s pretty easy. You write three zeros down the

15
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:15,000
对角线。还有我认为的排除
diagonal. There is also what I think of as an exclusion

16
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:21,920
规则。因此，在行X和列Y中，该元素将不是额外的Y.它将是另一个
rule. So, in row X and in column Y, that element will not be an extra Y. It will be the other

17
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,740
事情。在这种情况下，它将是Z.如果我们考虑循环旋转序列。
thing. And in this case, it will be a Z. If we consider a cyclic rotation sequence.

18
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:33,020
所以，我们有一个无穷无尽的序列-X，Y，Z，X，Y，Z等。如果我考虑这个元素
So, we have an endless sequence - X, Y, Z, X, Y, Z and so on. If I consider the element

19
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:40,020
在Y列和X行中，从Y移动到X，它在循环旋转中向后移动
in column Y and in row X, moving from Y to X, it is going backwards in that cyclic rotation

20
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:44,010
序列。因为我们正在按顺序倒退，所以我要打一个减号
sequence. Because we are going backwards in the sequence, I am going to put a minus sign

21
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:48,090
在那个特定的元素上。如果我们在这里看一下这个，我们就要去了
on that particular element. If we look at this one over here, we are going

22
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,909
从Z到X.而且，这是循环旋转序列中的前进。所以，我们给出这个
from Z to X. And, that’s a forward in the cyclic rotation sequence. So, we give this

23
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:55,140
元素一个积极的迹象。
element a positive sign.
