1
00:00:03,889 --> 00:00:09,000
让我们回顾一下我们在解决反向运动学问题方面所学到的东西
Let's recap what we've learnt about solving the inverse Kinematic problem for particular

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,529
机器人手臂。到目前为止，我们已经查看了分析解决方案，这涉及到我们创建模型
robot arms. So far we've looked at the analytic solution and that involved us creating a model

3
00:00:14,529 --> 00:00:20,249
机器人的关节和链接。我们写下正向运动学的方程式
of the robot's joints and links. We write down the equations for the forward kinematics

4
00:00:20,249 --> 00:00:25,169
机器人手臂，这是一个相对简单的事情。
of the robot arm and that's relatively a straightforward thing to do.

5
00:00:25,169 --> 00:00:29,369
接下来是困难的部分，我们需要写下很多方程式
Next comes the hard part, where we need to write down a lot of equations in attempt to

6
00:00:29,369 --> 00:00:35,110
解决未知的关节变量，这需要一些人类的洞察力。经常在
solve for the unknown joint variables and that requires some human insight. Often when

7
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:38,770
你试图做到这一点，你会发现自己在你来之前要去一些盲道
you're trying to do this, you'll find yourself going down some blind alleys before you come

8
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,989
退出并确定获得解决方案的正确方法。
back out and determine the right way to get to the solution.

9
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:48,730
这个过程可以使用计算机代数包自动化;你可以编写那些软件
This process can be automated, using a computer algebra package; you can write software that

10
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:54,949
将解决某类机器人手臂的逆运动学问题。最大的优势
will solve the inverse kinematics for certain classes of robot arms. The great advantage

11
00:00:54,949 --> 00:01:00,190
解析解决方案是它明确地显示了多个配置
of the analytic solution is that it explicitly shows the multiple configurations that the

12
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:06,380
机器人手臂可以进入。所以对于我们的两个链接机械手，我们展示了两个中间配置
robot arm can be in. So for our two link manipulator, we showed two configurations with the middle

13
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:10,590
接头位于对角​​线下方或对角线上方。
joint either below the diagonal line or above the diagonal line.

14
00:01:10,590 --> 00:01:15,750
对于Puma560机器人，我们展示了配置，就像左撇子或者左撇子一样
For the Puma 560 robot, we showed configurations where it's like a left handed person or a

15
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:22,780
右撇子等等。当您使用时，会明确地显示多种配置
right handed person and so on. The multiple configurations come out explicitly when you

16
00:01:22,780 --> 00:01:26,119
解决分析方程。
solve the analytic equations.

17
00:01:26,119 --> 00:01:30,119
分析解决方案的另一个优点是你最终为表达式编写表达式
Another advantage of the analytic solution is you end up writing expressions for the

18
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,350
关于末端执行器姿势的关节角度，它们非常紧凑，这意味着
joint angles in terms of the end effector pose and they are quite compact and that means

19
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:38,040
它们执行起来非常快。
that they are very fast to execute.

20
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,619
随着机器人中关节数量的增加，问题变得越来越困难。
The problem becomes increasingly difficult as the number of joints in the robot increases.

21
00:01:42,619 --> 00:01:48,219
在前面的部分中，我们得到了一个简单的两个关节机器人的解决方案
In an earlier section we derived the solution for a simple two joint robot and already that

22
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:53,189
花了很多幻灯片来提出解决方案。什么来到我们的
took quite a number of slides in order to come up with the solution. What comes to our

23
00:01:53,189 --> 00:01:59,350
救援是几十年来，聪明的人已经确定了反向运动解决方案
rescue is that over many decades, smart people have determined the inverse kinematic solutions

24
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:04,590
对于特定的机器人或特定类型的机器人，所以他们已经完成了艰苦的工作
for particular robots or for particular classes of robots, so they've done the hard work of

25
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,310
得出解决方案，这些已发表在文献中。
deriving the solutions and these have been published in the literature.

26
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:11,900
因此，如果你有一个特定的机器人，并且你正在寻找一个解决方案，那就去吧
So if you've got a particular robot and you're looking for a solution, go and hit up the

27
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,569
文献，看看有人已经为你解决了这个问题。
literature and see if somebody has already solved this problem for you.

28
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:20,629
当您尝试确定六自由度机器人的逆运动学时，
When you're trying to determine the inverse kinematics for a six degree of freedom robot,

29
00:02:20,629 --> 00:02:25,260
拥有所谓的“球形手腕”真的非常有用。现在是一个球形
it's really, really useful to have what's called a "Spherical Wrist." Now a spherical

30
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:31,459
如图所示，腕部是三个腕关节轴都在公共点相交的腕部
wrist is one in which the three wrist joint axes all intersect at a common point, as shown

31
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:37,519
在这个草图这里。几乎所有工业机器人都有球形手腕。真是太棒了
in this sketch here. Almost all industrial robots have a spherical wrist. It's quite

32
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:42,940
一个复杂的机制，但它确实很简单，当涉及到确定
a complex mechanism but it leads to great simplicity when it comes to determining the

33
00:02:42,940 --> 00:02:44,739
机器人的反向运动学。
inverse kinematics of the robot.

34
00:02:44,739 --> 00:02:49,620
事实上，它的作用是让我们将问题分成两部分。它允许我们解决
In fact what it does is allow us to partition the problem into two. It allows us to solve

35
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:55,930
对于机器人的末端执行器的位置，XYZ坐标然后分开
for the position of the robot’s end effector, the XYZ co-ordinate and then separately to

36
00:02:55,930 --> 00:03:01,190
求解机器人末端执行器的方向，即可以的方向
solve for the orientation of the robot's end effector, that is the orientation that could

37
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:07,170
用滚动，俯仰，偏航角或欧拉角表示。但是会发生什么
be expressed in terms roll, pitch, yaw angles or in terms of Euler angles. But what happens

38
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:10,650
如果无法确定分析解决方案？
if it's not possible to determine the analytic solution?

39
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,930
也许机器人没有球形手腕，或者如果它太难以计算
Perhaps the robot doesn't have a spherical wrist or what if it's just too hard to figure

40
00:03:14,930 --> 00:03:20,049
out或者你不能费心去完成需要确定的代数页面
out or you can't be bothered to go through the pages of algebra required to determine

41
00:03:20,049 --> 00:03:25,610
解决方案？那么有一个替代方案，那就是找到一个数值解决方案
the solution? Well there is an alternative and that is to find a numerical solution to

42
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:30,980
问题。我们总能确定机器人的前向运动学，这是相对直的
the problem. We can always determine the forward kinematics of a robot, that's relatively straight

43
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:36,590
正如我们在前一讲中所展示的那样前进。如果我们知道我们想要的姿势
forward to do as we showed in the previous lecture. If we know the desired pose of our

44
00:03:36,590 --> 00:03:42,480
机器人，我将称之为Ksi星，然后我们所要做的就是调整关节角度
robot, which I'm going to call Ksi star, then all we have to do is adjust the joint angles

45
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:48,319
直到前向运动学给出给我们的姿势Ksi等于期望值Ksi
until the pose given to us by the forward kinematics Ksi equals the desired value Ksi

46
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:53,909
星。所以你可以把它想象成拥有大量的表盘，每个表盘
star. So you could think of it perhaps as having a large number of dials, each dial

47
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:59,209
代表一个特定的关节角度，我只是调整所有这些表盘，直到
represents a particular joint angle and I’m just going to adjust all of those dials until

48
00:03:59,209 --> 00:04:05,049
机器人的末端效应器姿势等于我想要的姿势。一种更正式的描述方式
the robot's end effector pose equals the pose that I want. A more formal way of describing

49
00:04:05,049 --> 00:04:09,010
像这样的问题是将其表示为优化问题。
a problem like this is to represent it as an optimization problem.

50
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,840
我想要做的是最小化正向运动学给出的相对姿势
What I want to do is minimize the relative pose which is given by the forward kinematics

51
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,250
机器人与所需姿势的倒数复合，我想知道关节
of the robot compounded with the inverse of the desired pose and I want to know the joint

52
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:23,720
导致这种最小化的角度。
angles that cause this minimum.

53
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:28,480
我们主要讨论串联机器人，这些机器人是由一系列机器人组成的
We've mostly talked about serial linked robots and these are robots formed by a chain of

54
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:33,000
链接，从机器人的基础开始，我们有一个链接，该链接支撑第二个
links, starting at the base of the robot we have a link, that link holds up the second

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,530
链接，它保持第三个链接等等。
link, which holds up the third link and so on.

56
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:40,630
机器人的另一种结构是所谓的并联机器人，如图所示
An alternative structure for a robot is what's called a parallel link robot and that's shown

57
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:46,220
在右边。它们的优点是所有电机都放在底座中。
here on the right. They have the advantage that all the motors are placed in the base.

58
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:51,260
这比串行链路机器人更有优势，其中每个电机不仅要支撑它
This has advantages over a serial link robot where each motor has to hold up not only the

59
00:04:51,260 --> 00:04:55,700
下一个链接，但也驱动链接超出该链接。
next link but also the motor that drives the link beyond that.

60
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,960
平行连杆机器人也非常非常隆起，它们能够进行非常高速的运动。
Parallel link robots are also very, very ridged and they're capable of very high speed motion.

61
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:05,350
它们用于高速，非常精确的拾取和放置操作。所以对于一个序列
They're used for high speed, very precise, pick and place operations. So for a serial

62
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:10,670
链接机器人，运动学-正向运动学很容易确定，非常容易编写
link robot, the kinematics - the forward kinematics is very easy to determine, very easy to write

63
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:16,410
下。然而，对于并联机器人，正向运动学非常非常复杂
down. However for a parallel link robot, the forward kinematics is very, very complex and

64
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:21,720
甚至可能不存在分析形式。对于串行链接机器人，反向运动学
an analytical form may not even exist. For a serial link robot, the inverse kinematics

65
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:28,530
通常是复杂的，可能不存在分析形式。但对于大多数并行链接
is typically complex and analytic form may not exist. However for most parallel link

66
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:33,210
机器人，反向运动学实际上很容易确定和分析形式
robots, the inverse kinematics is actually very easy to determine and an analytic form

67
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:39,600
永远存在。因此串行和并行链接机器人之间存在一些互补性;一
always exists. So there is some complementarity between serial and parallel link robots; one

68
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,820
有一个简单的正向运动学，另一个有一个简单的反向运动学。
has an easy forward kinematics, the other has an easy inverse kinematics.
