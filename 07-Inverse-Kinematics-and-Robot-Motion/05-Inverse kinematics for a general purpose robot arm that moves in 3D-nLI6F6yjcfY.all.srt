1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:08,069
现在我们要看一个有六个关节或六个自由度的机器人
Now we're going to look at a robot with six joints or six degrees of freedom and this

2
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:14,680
是一个三维移动的机器人。我将从加载模型开始
is a robot that moves in three dimensions. I'm going to start by loading a model for

3
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:20,650
Puma560机器人在工作区中创建了许多机器人。最重要的
the Puma 560 robot and that creates a number of robots in the workspace. Most important

4
00:00:20,650 --> 00:00:26,650
这些是变量P560，这是一个表示对象的MATLAB对象。有
of these is the variable P560, this is a MATLAB object that represents an object. There are

5
00:00:26,650 --> 00:00:32,430
还有一些其他变量，这些变量代表特定的关节角度配置QZ
a few other variables as well and these represent particular joint angle configurations, QZ

6
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:38,020
例如，长度为6的向量全部为零，它表示零的集合
for instance is a vector of length six with all zeros and it represents the set of zero

7
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:41,500
这个特定机器人的关节角度。
joint angles for this particular robot.

8
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:46,000
机器人对象有很多方法和方法之一;情节方法，允许
The robot objects have got a lot of methods and one of the methods; the plot method, allows

9
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,570
我们来查看一个机器人的配置，所以这里是特定机器人的全部
us to view the configuration of a robot, so here is that particular robot when all the

10
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:58,180
关节角度等于零。我可以从许多不同的观点来看待这个问题
joint angles are equal to zero. I can look at this from a number of different viewpoints

11
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:03,430
并看到机器人，我们也可以在这里看到机器人末端执行器坐标系
and see the robot and we can see also the robot end effector co-ordinate frame here

12
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:08,840
显示机器人末端执行器的X，Y和Z轴。
showing the X, Y and Z axes of the robot end effector.

13
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,900
现在我们谈论的是反向运动学，所以我希望机器人去一个特定的
Now we're talking about inverse kinematics so I want the robot to go to a particular

14
00:01:12,900 --> 00:01:18,100
姿势，我要定义。首先，我要定义它的翻译
pose and I'm going to define that. First of all I'm going to define it's translational

15
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:24,540
使用函数transl的组件，我想要一个0.6坐标的坐标，一个Y坐标
component using the function transl and I want an X co-ordinate of 0.6, a Y co-ordinate

16
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:31,190
0.1和Z坐标为0，现在我需要给它一些方向。我做到了
of 0.1 and a Z co-ordinate of 0 and now I need to give it some orientation. And I do

17
00:01:31,190 --> 00:01:38,020
通过指定其角色，俯仰角和偏航角。我希望角色角度为0，我想要
that by specifying its role, pitch and yaw angles. I want the role angle to be 0, I want

18
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:45,000
桨距角为180度，我希望偏航角为0度，我指定
the pitch angle to be 180 degrees and I want the yaw angle to be 0 degrees and I specify

19
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,490
我用度数单位给出了角度。这是同质转换
that I have given the angles in terms of unit of degrees. And here is the homogeneous transformation

20
00:01:52,490 --> 00:01:56,170
表示我感兴趣的姿势的矩阵。
matrix representing the pose that I'm interested in.

21
00:01:56,170 --> 00:02:02,780
现在让我们看看那个特定的姿势，我可以将姿势叠加到图中
Now let's have a look at that particular pose and I can superimpose the pose into the figure

22
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:09,509
包含机器人，启用保持，我现在绘制特定的姿势，然后我们
that contains the robot, enable hold and I now plot that particular pose and then we

23
00:02:09,509 --> 00:02:14,950
可以看到代表这个姿势的坐标框架，我们可以在这里看看。
can see the co-ordinate frame which represents this pose and we can have a look around here.

24
00:02:14,950 --> 00:02:19,230
所以与这个姿势相关的位置是这个新蓝色坐标的起源
So the position associated with this pose is the origin of this new blue co-ordinate

25
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:27,340
框架，我们可以看到这个新框架的X，Y和Z轴的方向。
frame and we can see the orientation of this new frame in terms of its X, Y and Z axes.

26
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:32,770
现在我们的工作是确定机器人需要采用的关节角度，以便它的末端执行器
Now our job is to determine the joint angles the robot needs to adopt so that its end effector

27
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:39,120
与这个新的理想姿势对齐。使用反向运动学来做到这一点。有一个逆
lines up with this new desired pose. Do that using inverse kinematics. There is an inverse

28
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,810
与机器人对象相关的运动学方法和方法的名称是ikine，其中
kinematic method associated with the robot object and the method's name is ikine, which

29
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:49,459
反向运动学的简称，六，六自由度机器人和S因为
is short hand for inverse kinematics, six, for a six degree of freedom robot and S because

30
00:02:49,459 --> 00:02:56,239
它有一个球形手腕。我传入的唯一论点是T，即齐次变换
it has a spherical wrist. And the only argument that I pass in is T, the homogeneous transformation

31
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,060
代表所需的姿势。
representing the desired pose.

32
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:03,500
结果是一组关节角度，如果机器人采用这些关节角度，它
The result is the set of joint angles that if the robot adopted these joint angles, it

33
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:09,680
会实现这个姿势。好吧，让我们测试一下，我们可以将我们的机器人移动到这组关节
would achieve the pose. Well let's test that, we can move our robot to this set of joint

34
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:15,030
我们刚刚计算过的角度，我们可以看到机器人已经移动了。
angles that we've just computed and we can see here that the robot has definitely moved.

35
00:03:15,030 --> 00:03:18,849
现在让我们来看看这里发生了什么。所以我们可以看到中心
Now let's have a look around in here and see what's happened. So we can see that the center

36
00:03:18,849 --> 00:03:23,379
现在，末端执行器的排列与这个新的坐标框架的中心对齐
of the end effector is now lined up with the center of this new co-ordinate frame that

37
00:03:23,379 --> 00:03:29,840
我们介绍并且我们可以看到机器人末端执行器的X，Y和Z轴是有衬里的
we introduced and we can see that the X, Y and Z axes of the robot end effector are lined

38
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:37,069
我们刚刚介绍的蓝色框架的X，Y和Z轴。现在有点儿了
up with the X, Y and Z axes of the blue frame that we just introduced. Now it's a little

39
00:03:37,069 --> 00:03:43,569
在这个简图中难以确定这个特殊机器人的配置。
difficult in this stick figure plot, to determine the configuration of this particular robot.

40
00:03:43,569 --> 00:03:48,239
这是左手配置还是右手配置。是真的
Is this in a left handed configuration or a right handed configuration. It's really

41
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:53,940
有点难以分辨，但是有一种改进的方式来观察机器人，并且
a bit difficult to tell, however there is an improved way of looking at the robot, and

42
00:03:53,940 --> 00:04:00,110
这是使用Plot3D方法。第一次开始需要一点时间
that's using the method Plot 3D. It takes a little moment to get started the first time

43
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:07,269
你运行它是因为它需要将一些详细的机器人CAD模型加载到工作区中。
you run it because it needs to load some detailed CAD models of the robot into the workspace.

44
00:04:07,269 --> 00:04:15,280
我们在这里看到的是Puma560机器人的精美渲染图像，它非常棒
What we see here is then a beautifully rendered image of the Puma 560 robot and it's quite

45
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:21,449
清楚，机器人是左手配置，其夹持器的方向是直的
clear that the robot is in a left handed configuration and the orientation of its gripper is straight

46
00:04:21,449 --> 00:04:27,630
基本上在一个可以从水平表中拾取东西的配置中。
down basically in a configuration where it could pick things up from a horizontal table.

47
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:32,180
现在我们可能有兴趣将机器人置于不同的配置中。我们可以
Now we might be interested in putting the robot into a different configuration. We can

48
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:38,240
通过重新计算反向运动学来做到这一点，但这次我们将传递一个选项
do that by re-computing the inverse kinematics, but this time we're going to pass in an option

49
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,270
R，其要求对应于右手配置的关节角度。
R, which is asking for the joint angles that correspond to a right handed configuration.

50
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:48,990
这是一组关节角度，我们可以绘制这些，我们现在可以看到我们的机器人
Here is the set of joint angles and we can plot those and we can see now that our robot

51
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:54,770
很明显是右手配置。
is very clearly in a right handed configuration.

52
00:04:54,770 --> 00:05:00,650
现在我也可以要求它采用右手配置，而肘部则相反
Now I could also ask for it to be in a right handed configuration with the elbow down rather

53
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:06,340
而不是向上并传递选项D来表示。我们现在有一套不同的联合
than up and pass in the option D to indicate that. We have now a different set of joint

54
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:11,300
角度，你看它们与上面显示的值不同，我们可以绘制这个，我们可以
angles, you see that they differ to the values shown above and we can plot this and we can

55
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:16,400
看到我们的机器人现在是右手配置，但肘部向下
see that our robot now is in a right handed configuration but with its elbow down and

56
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:24,690
手腕确实是非常非常奇怪的姿势。看起来很尴尬。我也可以问
the wrist is in a very, very odd pose indeed. It looks quite awkward. I can also then ask

57
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:32,800
因为机器人处于左撇子配置，肘部向下，我可以绘制它
for the robot to be in a left handed configuration with the elbow being down and I can plot that

58
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:37,360
它看起来像这样......
and it looks something like this...

59
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,720
我们所看到的六维自由度机器人是三维运动的
What we've seen for this six degree of freedom robot that moves in three dimensions, is that

60
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:48,110
事实上，对于任何特定的末端执行器姿势，存在八种解决方案。有一个解决方案
there are in fact eight solutions for any particular end effector pose. There is a solution

61
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:53,759
在机器人处于左手或右手配置的情况下，有解决方案
where the robot is either in a left handed or right handed configuration, there is solutions

62
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,419
肘部向上，这意味着肘部高于肩部或在哪里
where the elbow is up, that means that the elbow is higher than the shoulder or where

63
00:05:57,419 --> 00:06:01,750
肘部向下;那就是肘部位于肩部以下的位置，并且有解决方案
the elbow is down; that's where the elbow is below the shoulder and there's solutions

64
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:08,979
在翻转或不翻转手腕的地方，在配置中旋转180度
where the wrist is flipped or not flipped, that's a rotation of 180 degrees in the configuration

65
00:06:08,979 --> 00:06:14,210
手腕对于带有双指夹具的机器人的情况，如此处所示，
of the wrist. For the case of the robot with a two fingered gripper, as is shown here,

66
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:20,350
然后围绕手腕轴旋转180度，有效地留下两根手指
then a rotation of 180 degrees around the wrist axis, leaves two fingers in effectively

67
00:06:20,350 --> 00:06:26,229
相同的配置，在抓取物体，采摘时没有区别
the same configuration and it makes no difference when it comes to grasping an object, picking

68
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:27,720
把它放下来。
it up or putting it down.
