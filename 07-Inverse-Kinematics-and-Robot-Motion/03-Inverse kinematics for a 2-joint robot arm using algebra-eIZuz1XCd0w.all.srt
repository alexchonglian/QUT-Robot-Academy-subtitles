1
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:07,970
在这里，我们有两个链接机器人，就像我们刚看到的那样，但这一次我们要去
Here we have the same two link robot as we just looked at but this time we're going to

2
00:00:07,970 --> 00:00:12,639
使用分析方法解决它，即我们将更多地依赖于代数，
solve it using an analytical approach, that is we're going to rely much more on algebra,

3
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:19,220
特殊的线性代数而不是几何。我们有一个表达式E，它是同质的
particular linear algebra rather than geometry. We have an expression E, which is the homogeneous

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:24,460
代表机器人事件的姿势的变换，我们看了这个
transformation which represents the pose of the robots endefector and we looked at this

5
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:31,500
在上一个讲座中，我们可以将先行者姿势写成一个基本同质的序列
in the last lecture, we can write the endefector pose as a sequence of elementary homogeneous

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:38,809
转换。通过Q1旋转，沿X方向平移A1，旋转
transformations. A rotation by Q1, a translation along the X direction by A1, a rotation by

7
00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:45,859
Q2然后通过A2在X方向上进行平移。如果我将其展开，则将所有数据相乘
Q2 and then a translation in the X direction by A2. If I expand this out, multiply all

8
00:00:45,859 --> 00:00:51,870
转换在一起，我得到这里显示的表达;一个三乘三的同质变换
the transformations together, I get the expression shown here; a three by three homogeneous transformation

9
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,069
矩阵表示机器人的行为者的姿势。
matrix representing the pose of the robot's endefector.

10
00:00:56,069 --> 00:01:00,949
现在对于这个特殊的双链机器人，我们只关心它的位置
Now for this particular two link robot, we are only interested in the position of its

11
00:01:00,949 --> 00:01:06,159
exefector，它是X和Y坐标，它们是同质中的这两个元素
endefector, it's X and Y co-ordinate and they are these two elements within the homogeneous

12
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,780
转换矩阵，所以我要复制出来。所以这又是我们的表达
transformation matrix, so I'm going to copy those out. So here again is our expression

13
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:16,990
对于X和Y以及我们要做的是一个相当普遍的技巧，我们将会解决问题
for X and Y and what we're going to do is a fairly common trick, we're going to square

14
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:23,610
并添加这两个方程式，我得到一个看起来像这样的关系。现在我可以解决了
and add these two equations and I get a relationship that looks like this. Now I can solve for

15
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:31,750
根据完成者姿势X和Y以及机器人常数A1和A2的关节角度Q2。
the joint angle Q2 in terms of the endefector pose X and Y and the robot's constants A1 and A2.

16
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:36,140
现在我要做的是应用角度身份的总和。我要扩展它们
Now what I'm going to do is apply the sum of angles identity. I'm going to expand these

17
00:01:36,140 --> 00:01:43,289
条件，Q1加Q2的正弦或Q1加Q2的cos，以使生活更轻松一点，我
terms, sine of Q1 plus Q2 or cos of Q1 plus Q2 and to make life a little bit easier, I'm

18
00:01:43,289 --> 00:01:48,409
要做一些变电站，所以无论我在哪里有cosQ2，我都要写C2和哪里
going to make some substations, so where ever I had cos Q2, I'm going to write C2 and where

19
00:01:48,409 --> 00:01:54,240
我有没有正常的Q2，我要写S2。当人们这是一个相当普遍的速记
ever I had sine Q2, I’m going to write S2. It's a fairly common shorthand when people

20
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,969
正在研究机器人运动方程。以下是制作这些方程式后的方程式
are looking at robot kinematic equations. And here are the equations after making those

21
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:04,119
换人。看看这两个方程式，我可以看出它们很好地融入了它们
substitutions. Looking at these two equations, I can see that they fall into a very well

22
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:10,280
已知的形式，对于那种形式，有一个众所周知的解决方案。所以我要考虑一下
known form and for that form there is a very well known solution. So I'm going to consider

23
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:15,930
只是其中一个方程，Y的等式，并使用我们众所周知的身份和它
just one of the equations, the equation for Y and using our well known identity and it's

24
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:21,870
解决方案，我可以确定变量的值小a，小b和小c
solution, I can determine the values for the variables little a, little b and little c

25
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:27,390
一旦我确定了那些，那么我可以写下Q1的解决方案
and once I've determined those, then I can just write down the solution for Q1, which

26
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:31,209
在这种特殊情况下，它相当于theta。
is the equivalent of theta in this particular case.

27
00:02:31,209 --> 00:02:36,530
这里再次是我们对Q1的表达，复制了上一张幻灯片，我们可能还记得
Here again is our expression for Q1, copied over from the previous slide and we may remember

28
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:41,799
从我们工作的早期开始，我们确定了这种特殊的关系;X平方加
from earlier in our workings that we determined this particular relationship; X squared plus

29
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:47,390
Y平方等于这个特殊的复杂表达式。所以我可以用和替代
Y squared is equal to this particular complex expression. So I can substitute that in and

30
00:02:47,390 --> 00:02:53,830
做一些简化，我最终得到Q1的这种稍微不那么复杂的表达式。和
do some simplification and I end up with this slightly less complex expression for Q1. And

31
00:02:53,830 --> 00:02:58,760
它与我在上一节中按照几何方法得到的表达式相同。
it is the same expression that I got following the geometric approach in the previous section.
