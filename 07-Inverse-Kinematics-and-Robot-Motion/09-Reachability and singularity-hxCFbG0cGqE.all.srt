1
00:00:03,259 --> 00:00:08,289
我们现在来看一些实际问题，其中之一就是可达性。我们的机器人有
Let's look at some practical issues now and one of these is reachability. Our robot has

2
00:00:08,289 --> 00:00:14,410
只有有限的链接。因此，有大量可能的目标位置
only got finite links. So, there are a large number of possible goal locations that the

3
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:20,119
机器人实际上无法触及。如果该点无法到达那么，
robot is physically just not going to be able to reach. If the point is unreachable then,

4
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:25,830
它通常会导致我们的反向运动学解决方案出现一些问题。一个数字
it will generally lead to some problem in our inverse kinematics solution. A numerical

5
00:00:25,830 --> 00:00:31,670
算法将无法收敛。对于分析方法，我们可能最终找到
algorithm will fail to converge. For an analytic approach, we may end up finding

6
00:00:31,670 --> 00:00:35,489
我们正在计算负数的平方根，或者我们可能发现我们是
that we're computing the square root of a negative number or we may find that we're

7
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:41,079
计算幅度大于1的数的反cos符号。
computing the inverse cos sign of a number whose magnitude is greater than 1.

8
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:48,069
在我们的反向运动学中会出现一些数值问题。另一个问题是奇点
Some numerical problem will crop up in our inverse kinematics. Another problem is a singularity

9
00:00:48,069 --> 00:00:51,979
这与我们看到的万向节锁问题有很多相似之处
and this has got a lot of similarities to the Gimbal lock problem that we looked at

10
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:57,069
更早。在这里，我们可以看到Prima560的手腕
much earlier. Here, we can see the wrist of a Prima 560

11
00:00:57,069 --> 00:01:03,600
机器人，我们可以看到，在这个特殊的配置中，第4关节的轴是
robot and we can see that in this particular configuration, the axis of the 4th joint is

12
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:09,700
平行于第6关节的轴。它现在将动画这个机器人，看看是什么
parallel to the axis of the 6th joint. It would be now animate this robot and look what

13
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:15,620
当我们移动机器人的关节4时发生。整个手腕组件都像这样移动
happens when we move joint 4 of the robot. The whole wrist assembly moves like this and

14
00:01:15,620 --> 00:01:20,830
现在我们要移动机器人的关节6。我们看到它导致完全相同的排序
now we're going to move joint 6 of the robot. We see that it causes exactly the same sort

15
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:26,390
末端执行器的运动。现在，我们要做的是对抗旋转关节4
of motion of the end effector. Now, what we're going to do is to counter rotate joints 4

16
00:01:26,390 --> 00:01:31,750
因此，如果关节4增加，关节6正在减小，最终结果是关节4
and joint 6 so if joint 4 is increasing, joint 6 is decreasing, net result being that the

17
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:36,750
结束因素根本不动。所以，就像在GimbalLock案中一样，我们已经输了
end factor does not move at all. So, just as in Gimbal Lock case, we've lost

18
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:42,200
自由法令。关节4和关节6导致完全相同的运动
the decree of freedom. Joint 4 and joint 6 result in exactly the same motion that the

19
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:47,050
机器人末端效应器和机器人技术，我们称之为奇点。
robots end effector and in robotics, we refer to this as a singularity.

20
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:52,600
实际意义上的含义是接头4和接头6的轴线是否对齐
What it means in practical sense is if the axis of joints 4 and joint 6 are aligned like

21
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,960
这就是机器人末端执行器不可能采用某些特定的方向。
this then it's not possible for the robot end effector to adopt some particular orientations.

22
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:03,560
为了打破这种对齐，摆脱奇点，重要的是
In order to break that alignment, to move out of singularity, it's important that the

23
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:08,840
第五关节角θ5设定为不等于0的某个值。
5th joint angle theta 5 is set to some value that's not equal to 0.
