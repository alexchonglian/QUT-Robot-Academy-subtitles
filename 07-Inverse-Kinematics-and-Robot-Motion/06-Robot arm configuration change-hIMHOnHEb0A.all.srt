1
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,930
这里我们有一个熟悉的2link机器人，配置中Q2大于0。
Here we have our familiar 2link robot in the configuration where Q2 is greater than 0.

2
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:16,529
而且那就是具有相同末端执行器位置的机器人，但Q2现在更少了
And over laid on that is the robot with the same end effector position but Q2 is now less

3
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:22,929
这是这个机器人的两种可能的解决方案，以实现这一目标
than 0. These are the two possible solutions for this robot in order to achieve this particular

4
00:00:22,929 --> 00:00:28,679
端点姿势。我们可能对机器人从一种配置移动到哪种配置感兴趣
endpoint pose. We might be interested in how the robot moves from one configuration to

5
00:00:28,679 --> 00:00:34,110
另一个。对于机器人来说这是一个有趣的运动，因为终点位置是
the other. It's an interesting motion for the robot because the end point position is

6
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:39,570
完全相同，但关节角度Q1和Q2需要遵循一些有趣的轨迹
exactly the same but the joint angles Q1 and Q2 need to follow some interesting trajectory

7
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:43,450
从第一个配置移动到第二个配置。
to move from the first configuration to the second.

8
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:49,140
这是三个维度中更生动的例子。这显示了PUMA560机器人正在抓住
Here's a more vivid example in three dimensions. This shows a PUMA 560 robot moving to grab

9
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,940
一个球。现在我们可以看到机器人正在左手配置中掌握
a ball. Now we can see that the robot is making that grasp in either the left hand configuration

10
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:59,750
或右手配置。我们可能会问一个问题，“机器人是如何移动的
or the right handed configuration. We might ask the question, "How does the robot move

11
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:04,869
从左手配置到右手配置？我们如何计算
from a left handed configuration to a right handed configuration? How do we compute the

12
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:08,820
允许这种情况发生的轨迹？“
trajectory that allows that to happen?"

13
00:01:08,820 --> 00:01:14,760
我们将再次为PUMA560机器人定义模型。将其加载到工作区中。
Once again we're going to define a model for our PUMA 560 robot. Load that into the workspace.

14
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:21,900
我们有机器人对象。在这里说工作区变量p560。我要定义一个姿势
We have the robot object. Say here. The workspace variable p560. I'm going to define a pose

15
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:29,580
我希望我的机器人能够采用。让我们通过这种同质化转变给他
that I'd like my robot to adopt. And let's give him by this homogeneous transformation

16
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:36,920
矩阵在这里。我将定义一个表示连接角度集的新工作空间变量
matrix here. I'm going to define a new workspace variable that represents the set of join angles

17
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:43,950
机器人要求在左手配置中采用这种特殊姿势。我用
required by the robot to adopt this particular pose in the left handed configuration. I use

18
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:50,540
ikine6s方法，传递表示所需姿势的均匀变换
the ikine6s method, pass in the homogeneous transformation representing the desired pose

19
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:56,280
并且开关L指示机器人将处于左手配置和此状态
and the switch L to indicate the robot is to be in a left handed configuration and this

20
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:02,210
是所需的关节角度集合。我可以为右手配置做同样的事情。
is the required set of joint angles. I can do the same thing for a right handed configuration.

21
00:02:02,210 --> 00:02:07,350
我将为一个名为QR的变量创建一个新工作区。
I'm going to create a new workspace for a variable called QR.

22
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:12,450
我们来看看这些特殊的机器人配置。我可以绘制配置
Let's have a look at these particular robot configurations. I can plot the configuration

23
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:19,480
QL。它在棒图表示中看起来像这样。让我从一个看看
QL. And it looks like this in stick figure representation. Let me look at that from a

24
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:26,310
不同的有利位置。对于右手配置，它看起来像这样。现在
different vantage point. And it looks like this for the right handed configuration. Now

25
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:30,120
比我们自己领先一点，我要做的就是创造一条轨迹
getting a little bit ahead of ourselves, what I'm going to do is to create a trajectory

26
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,239
并显示机器人从所有关节角度相等的配置移动
and show the robot moving from the configuration where all those joint angles are equal to

27
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,590
0到左手姿势。这将在50个时间步骤中完成。
0 to the left handed pose. It's going to do that in 50 time steps.

28
00:02:39,590 --> 00:02:45,810
现在是jtraj函数的结果，我们将在后面的讲座中详细讨论这个问题
Now the result of the jtraj function and we'll talk more about this later in the lecture

29
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:52,319
是一个包含50行和6列的矩阵。每行对应于特定的时间步长。行
is a matrix with 50 rows and 6 columns. Each row corresponds to particular time step. Row

30
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,160
1是轨迹的第一点。第50行是轨迹的最后一点。每
1 is the first point of the trajectory. Row 50 is the last point of the trajectory. Each

31
00:02:57,160 --> 00:03:00,700
列表示特定的关节角度。
column represents a particular joint angle.

32
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:06,660
现在，机器人工具箱可以轻松处理轨迹。所以我绘制而不是特定的
Now the robotic tool box can easily deal with trajectories. So I plot but instead of a particular

33
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:11,940
关节角度我绘制一个轨迹。我们看到机器人现在从0角配置移动
joint angle I plot a trajectory. We see the robot now moving from 0 angle configuration

34
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,440
左手配置。
to a left handed configuration.

35
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:20,760
我可以改变这两个，从0角度配置移动
I can change this two, move from the 0 angle configuration

36
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:26,239
右手配置，我可以再次绘制。看机器人在做什么
to the right handed configuration, and once again I can plot that. See the robot doing

37
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:34,660
一个非常复杂的动作。最后我能做的就是展示机器人从哪里移动
a quite convoluted looking motion. Finally what I can do is show the robot moving from

38
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:39,160
左手配置到右手配置。
the left handed configuration to the right handed configuration.

39
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:44,349
这是一个有趣的动作，因为机器人开始和结束轨迹
And this is an interesting motion because the robot starts and ends the trajectory with

40
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:49,739
它的末端效应器具有完全相同的姿势。但在机器人之间将会经历
its end effector in exactly the same pose. But in between the robot is going to go through

41
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:56,739
一些扭曲，以便从左撇子机器人变为右撇子机器人。
some contortions in order to change from being a left handed robot to a right handed robot.

42
00:03:56,739 --> 00:04:01,379
计算轨迹，然后我们将看一下。有趣的是看
Compute the trajectory and then we're going to have a look at that. Interesting to see

43
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:06,129
机器人在这做什么。您可以看到动作非常复杂，末端效应器结束
what the robot does here. You can see that the motion is quite complex and the end effector ends

44
00:04:06,129 --> 00:04:13,409
就在它开始的地方。有时在制造场景中，机器人确实需要改变
up just where it started. Sometimes in a manufacturing scenario, the robot does exactly need to change

45
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:18,329
从左撇子到右撇子。也许它需要访问对象
from being left handed to being right handed. Perhaps it needs to access objects at the

46
00:04:18,329 --> 00:04:22,320
其工作空间的极端和需要改变配置。
extreme ends of its workspace and needs to change configuration.

47
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,830
因此，这些配置改变运动，机器人的所有运动都没有网络
So these configuration change motions, there is no net over all the motion of the robot

48
00:04:28,830 --> 00:04:33,979
但是当它正在进行配置更改时，可能会有一些非常狂野和令人兴奋的事情
but while it's doing the configuration change, there can be some quite wild and exciting

49
00:04:33,979 --> 00:04:39,060
联合议案。当你指挥这样的动作时，你需要有点小心
joint motions. You need to be a little bit careful when you command such a motion that

50
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:42,560
机器人不会在其工作空间中碰撞任何东西。
the robot is not going to collide with anything in its workspace.
