1
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,840
使用称为磁力计的传感器测量磁场。
Magnetic field is measured using a sensor called a magnetometer.

2
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:12,630
最常见的固态磁力计类型是霍尔效应传感器，它可以测量
The most common type of solid state magnetometer is a Hall effect sensor and it measures the

3
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:15,400
磁场垂直于芯片表面。
magnetic field normal to the chip surface.

4
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:20,409
能够测量磁场的三个正交分量是非常有用的
It’s very useful to be able to measure the three orthogonal components of magnetic field

5
00:00:20,409 --> 00:00:21,409
向量。
vector.

6
00:00:21,409 --> 00:00:25,970
因此，通常，三个正交霍尔效应传感器被封装到单个芯片中
So typically, three orthogonal Hall effect sensors are packaged in to a single chip along

7
00:00:25,970 --> 00:00:30,970
与所有相关的电子设备，通常这些都有一个简单的串行接口
with all the associated electronics and typically these have a simple serial interface that

8
00:00:30,970 --> 00:00:33,720
允许它们轻松连接到微控制器。
allows them to be easily connected to a micro-controller.

9
00:00:33,720 --> 00:00:39,980
因此，为了确定身体在空间中的方向，我们使用加速度计
So, in order to determine the orientation of a body in space, we use the accelerometers

10
00:00:39,980 --> 00:00:44,440
确定向下方向，重力矢量的方向。
to determine the downward direction, the direction of the gravity vector.

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,420
并且，我们用它来确定水平面中的磁场分量
And, we use that to determine the magnetic field component in the horizontal plane which

12
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:54,579
我们可以认为它与传统机械上的针尖方向相同
we can think of as being the same as the direction of the needle points on a traditional mechanical

13
00:00:54,579 --> 00:00:55,980
罗盘。
compass.

14
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:59,750
为了使这个有形，再次考虑我的手机的例子，我附上了一个
To make this tangible, consider again the example of my phone and I have attached a

15
00:00:59,750 --> 00:01:01,429
身体框架到手机。
body frame to the phone.

16
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:07,350
z轴在屏幕之外，y轴在屏幕上方，x轴在屏幕上方
The z-axis is out of the screen, y-axis is up the screen and the x-axis is across the

17
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,220
屏幕从左到右。
screen from left to right.

18
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:15,070
我要将磁力计与每个轴对齐，结果称为三轴
I’m going to align a magnetometer with each of these axes and the result is called a tri-axial

19
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:18,250
磁力计，因为那里有三个磁力计。
magnetometer because there are three magnetometers there.

20
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:22,720
现在让我们谈谈我们如何处理磁力计的信息。
Let’s talk now about how we process the information from the magnetometer.

21
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,990
再一次，我有一个世界坐标系，表示为零。
Once again, I have a world coordinate frame denoted zero.

22
00:01:25,990 --> 00:01:29,920
再次，z轴平行于重力矢量。
Once again, the z-axis is parallel to the gravity vector.

23
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,340
它直指向上。
It’s pointing straight upwards.

24
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,600
并且，x轴与磁北对齐。
And, the x-axis is aligned with the magnetic north.

25
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,860
在这种情况下，我可以根据世界参考编写磁场矢量
In this case, I can write the magnetic field vector with respect to the world reference

26
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:44,670
坐标框架为B，我可以查看的磁场矢量的大小
coordinate frame as B, the magnitude of the magnetic field vector which I can look up

27
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:51,810
如果我知道我在这个星球上的位置，以及磁倾角的余弦和正弦，就在桌子上
in a table if I know my location on the planet, and the cosine and sine of the magnetic inclination

28
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:52,810
角度。
angle.

29
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,421
该向量位于xz平面中。
This vector lies in the x-z plane.

30
00:01:54,421 --> 00:01:58,530
它在y方向上没有任何组件。
It has got no component in the y direction.

31
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:03,860
从世界框架到车身框架的旋转变换是根据世界框架给出的
The rotational transform from the world frame to the body frame is given in terms of the

32
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,230
滚动，俯仰和偏航角度。
roll, pitch and yaw angles.

33
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:11,730
我们已经讨论过如何从加速度计确定滚转角和俯仰角
We have already talked about how to determine the roll and pitch angles from the accelerometer

34
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,730
测量。
measurements.

35
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:17,060
手机中的磁力计测量坐标系B和中的磁场
The magnetometers in the phone measure the magnetic field in the coordinate frame B and

36
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:19,440
这让我可以写下这段关系。
that allows me to write this relationship.

37
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:25,720
而且，现在我们可以求出偏航角psi，它就是滚转角和俯仰角
And, now we can solve for the yaw angle psi and it is in terms of the roll and pitch angles

38
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:28,540
我们根据加速度计测量结果确定。
that we determined from the accelerometer measurements.

39
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:34,569
测得的磁场强度BX，BY和BZ，已知的磁场长度
The measured magnetic field strength, BX, BY and BZ, the known length of the magnetic

40
00:02:34,569 --> 00:02:39,420
场矢量，大写B和已知的倾角，大写I.
field vector, capital B, and the known inclination angle, capital I.

41
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:45,140
如果我们知道我们在地球表面的位置，我们可以查看B和I。
And both B and I, we can look up if we know our location on the surface of the planet.

42
00:02:45,140 --> 00:02:47,510
地球的磁场很弱。
The magnetic field of the earth is quite weak.

43
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:52,140
因此，磁力计需要对磁场非常敏感，这就是磁力计
Therefore, magnetometers need to be very sensitive to magnetic field and this makes magnetometers

44
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:57,230
非常容易受到电流流动产生的杂散磁场的影响
very susceptible to stray magnetic fields that are created by electric currents flowing

45
00:02:57,230 --> 00:03:01,370
内部电子设备和电动机。
inside electronic devices and also from electric motors.

46
00:03:01,370 --> 00:03:05,740
建造在室内操作的机器人的机器人专家经常受到结构的挫败
Roboticists building robots that operate indoors are often frustrated by the structural

47
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:09,220
建筑物中扭曲地球磁场的钢构件。
steel elements of the building which distort the earth’s magnetic field.

48
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:14,430
墙上还有电源线，还有Wi-Fi接入点和设备
There are also power cables in the walls and there are Wi-Fi access points and equipment

49
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:19,459
壁橱也会产生磁场，这可能会混淆主要依赖的机器人
closets which also create magnetic field which can confuse robots that rely predominantly

50
00:03:19,459 --> 00:03:21,380
关于磁场传感。
on magnetic field sensing.

51
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:26,569
我真的很喜欢探索远方的先锋十号卫星的旧照片
I really like this old picture of the Pioneer ten satellite which is exploring the far reaches

52
00:03:26,569 --> 00:03:30,819
我们的太阳系。背面有一堆电子设备和火箭发动机
of our solar system. There’s a bunch of electronics and a rocket motor on the back

53
00:03:30,819 --> 00:03:33,950
一个大盘子，指向地球的行星。
of a large dish which is pointed back at Planet Earth.

54
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:40,590
并且，在长长的细长臂上是磁力计仪器，它感应到局部磁场
And, on a long slender boom is the magnetometer instrument which is sensing the local magnetic

55
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:45,240
他们可以从其他电子产品中找到远离它们的位置

56
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,240
在航天器上。
in the space craft.

57
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:51,790
而且，正是由于这个原因，磁力计对杂散磁场非常敏感
And, that’s for exactly this reason that magnetometer is very sensitive to stray magnetic

58
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:51,819
领域。
