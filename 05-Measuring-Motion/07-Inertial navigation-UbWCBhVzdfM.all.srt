1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:06,390
我们研究了许多惯性传感器。
We've studied a number of inertial sensors.

2
00:00:06,390 --> 00:00:10,330
我们看到的第一个传感器是加速度计，它测量总量
The first sensor that we looked at was the accelerometer and that measures the total

3
00:00:10,330 --> 00:00:12,509
加速身体。
acceleration of a body.

4
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:16,590
这种加速可能是由于作用在身体上的力或加速度可能是由于
That acceleration might be due to forces acting on the body or the acceleration might be due

5
00:00:16,590 --> 00:00:19,280
重力作用于身体。
to gravity acting on the body.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:24,020
如果作用在身体上的唯一力是重力，那么我们可以使用测量的加速度
If the only force acting on a body is gravity, then we can use the acceleration measured

7
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:29,710
在身体上确定相对于重力矢量的滚转角和俯仰角

8
00:00:29,710 --> 00:00:32,230
或向下的方向。
or the downward direction.

9
00:00:32,230 --> 00:00:37,149
我们研究了能够测量角速度分量的陀螺仪
We looked at gyroscopes which are able to measure components of the angular velocity

10
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:38,149
的身体。
of the body.

11
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:42,100
而且，我们研究了可以感应地球磁性成分的磁力计
And, we looked at magnetometers which can sense components of the Earth’s magnetic

12
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:47,589
相对于附着在物体上的坐标系的场。
field with respect to the coordinate frame attached to the body of the object.

13
00:00:47,589 --> 00:00:52,219
我们可以结合加速度计和磁力计的信息来确定方向
We can combine information from accelerometers and magnetometers to determine the orientation

14
00:00:52,219 --> 00:00:55,359
关于磁北的身体。

15
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,079
最早的惯性导航系统类型被称为万向节和
The earliest types of inertial navigation systems were referred to as gimballed and

16
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:03,949
它们是我在本讲座中很早就展示的非常大的乐器。
they are very large instruments that I showed very early on in this lecture.

17
00:01:03,949 --> 00:01:09,340
它包含一个自由浮动的陀螺稳定平台，称为稳定元件
It contains a free floating gyro-stabilized platform referred to as the stable element

18
00:01:09,340 --> 00:01:12,350
它在这里由坐标系I显示。
and it’s shown here by the coordinate frame I.

19
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:17,310
该平台通过万向节机构连接到车辆。
That platform is connected to the vehicle by a gimbal mechanism.

20
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,710
随着车辆的方向改变，车身框架附接到车辆
As the orientation of the vehicle changes, the body frame which is attached to the vehicle

21
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:28,460
变化，但惯性坐标系I在空间中保持固定。
changes, but the inertial coordinate frame I remains fixed in space.

22
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:33,039
因此，我们可以通过测量车辆的角度来确定车辆的方向
We can, therefore, determine the orientation of a vehicle by measuring the angles of the

23
00:01:33,039 --> 00:01:38,079
惯性框架固定在空间和车身框架之间的万向节
gimbals between the inertial frame which is fixed in space and the body frame which is

24
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,520
附在车上。
attached to the vehicle.

25
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:45,770
加速度计安装在陀螺稳定平台上，因此可以测量加速度
The accelerometers are mounted on the gyro- stabilized platform, so they measure acceleration

26
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:48,060
在惯性框架中的车辆。
of the vehicle in the inertial frame.

27
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:53,080
但是如果我们想要，并且我们知道车辆相对于惯性的方向
But if we want to, and we know the orientation of the vehicle with respect to the inertial

28
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:59,420
框架，我们可以将加速度矢量旋转到车身框架。
frame, we can rotate the acceleration vector in to the vehicles body frame.

00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:05,310
这是阿波罗宇宙飞船上使用的万向节惯性测量单元的示意图。
This is a schematic of the gimballed inertial measurement unit used on the Apollo spacecraft.

30
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:10,810
稳定元件在这里显示，它包含三个旋转陀螺仪并保持
The stable element is shown here and it contains three spinning gyroscopes and they maintain

31
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:14,690
该平台相对于恒星的方向不变。
the orientation of that platform constant with respect to the stars.

32
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:21,709
该平台还包含三个加速度计，XA，YA和ZA。
That platform also contains three accelerometers indicated here, XA, YA and ZA.

33
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:26,760
万向节机构有效地允许航天器围绕稳定平台旋转
The gimbal mechanism effectively allows the spacecraft to rotate about the stable platform

34
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,980
而万向节的角度是由今天标准的老式传感器测量的
and the gimbal angles are measured by rather old fashioned sensors by today’s standard

35
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:32,410
叫做解析器。
called resolvers.

36
00:02:32,410 --> 00:02:38,090
今天，几乎所有惯性测量单元都使用所谓的捷联配置。
Today, almost all inertial measurement units use what’s called the strap-down configuration.

37
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:43,510
我们有车身框架B连接到车辆，加速度计和陀螺仪测量
We have a body frame B attached to the vehicle and the accelerometers and gyroscopes measure

38
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:48,769
沿着每个车身框架轴和陀螺仪的加速度测量角度
acceleration along each of the body frame axis and the gyroscopes measure the angular

00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:53,099
关于每个车身框架坐标轴的速度分量。
velocity components about each of the body frame coordinate axes.

40
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:59,290
随着车辆方向的改变，车身框架B也发生变化，我们测量角速度
As the vehicle orientation changes, so does the body frame B, we measure the angular velocity

41
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:05,060
在坐标系B中，我们将其随时间积分以确定方向
in the coordinate frame B and we integrate that over time to determine the orientation

42
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:06,549
车辆
of the vehicle.

43
00:03:06,549 --> 00:03:11,180
一旦我们知道车身在车身框架中的方向，我们就可以将其旋转回来
Once we know the orientation of the vehicle in the body frame, we can rotate it back to

44
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:15,719
