00:00:05,049 --> 00:00:10,990
在本节中，我们将研究计算正交旋转矩阵的导数。
In this section we're going to look at computing the derivative of an orthogonal rotation matrix.

2
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:15,600
正交矩阵的一个特性是它的倒数等于它的转置
One of the properties of an orthogonal matrix is that it's inverse is equal to its transpose

3
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:22,200
所以我们可以写出这个简单的关系R次，它的转置必须等于单位矩阵。
so we can write this simple relationship R times it's transpose must be equal to the identity matrix.

4
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:27,200
首先，我将考虑通过角度θ旋转的简单情况
First off I'm going to consider the simple case of a rotation by the angle theta about

5
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:32,649
X轴。我可以采用关于theta的衍生物并使用链规则
the X-axis. I can take the derivative with respect to theta and using the chain rule

6
00:00:32,649 --> 00:00:38,920
我可以写这个。应用此身份我可以用这种特殊的形式重写它
I can write this. Applying this identity I can rewrite it in this particular form and

7
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:44,649
我可以通过引入符号S来表示此表达式来简化它。
I can simplify it by introducing the symbol S to represent this expression here.

8
00:00:44,649 --> 00:00:49,679
矩阵S具有一个有趣的属性。如果我将它添加到它的转置，结果将会
The matrix S has an interesting property. If I add it to its transpose the result will

9
00:00:49,679 --> 00:00:55,480
等于零。并且这种矩阵被称为偏斜对称矩阵。
be equal to zero. And this kind of matrix is referred to as a skew-symmetric matrix.

10
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:59,730
偏斜对称矩阵的性质也可以这样写。所以这种
That property of the skew-symmetric matrix can also be written like this. So this kind

11
00:00:59,730 --> 00:01:04,320
矩阵的有时也被称为反对称矩阵。
of matrix is also sometimes referred to as an anti-symmetric matrix.

12
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,430
这些矩阵总是单数的，它确定总是等于零。
These matrices are always singular that is that it determines is always equal to zero.

13
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:15,070
任何矩阵都可以写成对称矩阵和斜对称矩阵之和。
Any matrix can be written as the sum of a symmetric matrix and a skew-symmetric matrix.

14
00:01:15,070 --> 00:01:19,390
在三维中，斜对称矩阵具有这种形式。它有一个非常独特的
In three dimensions the skew-symmetric matrix has this form. It's got a very distinctive

15
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:26,190
零对角线，此矩阵x，y，z和每个矩阵中只有三个独特的元素
zero diagonal and there are only three unique elements in this matrix x, y, z and each of

16
00:01:26,190 --> 00:01:31,060
它们带有正号和负号。现在有趣的特点了
them appears with a positive sign and a negative sign. Now the interesting characteristic of

17
00:01:31,060 --> 00:01:36,060
斜对称矩阵是一种编写向量叉积关系的方法
the skew-symmetric matrix is it’s a way to write the vector cross product relationship

18
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,840
作为从矢量A乘以的矢量计算的斜对称矩阵的乘积
as the product of a skew-symmetric matrix computed from the vector A multiplied by the

19
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,660
矢量B.因此，交叉积可以变成矩阵矢量积。
vector B. So cross product can be turned into a matrix vector product.

20
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:51,080
这是S的早期表达式，我可以写下矩阵的表达式
Here's our earlier expression for S and I can write down an expression for a matrix

21
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:56,230
它表示围绕X轴旋转角度θ。如果我替换这些
which represents rotation about the X axis by the angle theta. If I substitute these

22
00:01:56,230 --> 00:02:00,960
值，并简化我最终得到一个包含很多零的非常简单的矩阵
values in, and simplify I end up with a very simple matrix containing a lot of zeroes one

23
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:07,040
还有一个。回顾我们早期的表达式，即对称矩阵这个矩阵
and a minus one. Recalling our earlier expression for a skew-symmetric matrix this matrix that

24
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:14,100
我刚刚写下来，我可以写为矢量[100]的偏斜对称矩阵。所以
I've just written down I can write as a skew- symmetric matrix of the vector [1 0 0]. So the

25
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,390
相对于θ的旋转矩阵的导数由偏斜的乘积给出-
derivative of a rotation matrix with respect to theta is given by the product of a skew-

26
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:24,730
对称矩阵乘以原始旋转矩阵。
symmetric matrix multiplied by the original rotation matrix.

27
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:29,700
我可以执行代数操作，围绕Y轴旋转，也可以
I can perform the algebraic manipulation for a rotation around the Y axis and also for

28
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,640
围绕Z轴旋转，我在这里得到这些表达式，你可以清楚地看到一些
a rotation around the Z axis and I get these expressions here and you can clearly see some

29
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:40,640
一种模式。现在让我们考虑一般情况。关于向量L的旋转
kind of pattern. Now let's consider the general case. A rotation about the vector L by an

30
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,830
角θ和它可以表明这等于斜对称的乘积
angle theta and it can be shown that this is equal to the product of a skew-symmetric

31
00:02:45,830 --> 00:02:52,260
从矢量L乘以原始旋转矩阵计算的矩阵。
matrix computed from the vector L multiplied by the original rotation matrix.

32
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:58,330
如果我现在将表达式的两边乘以deethetadeeT，那就是theta的变化率，
If I now multiply both sides of the expression by dee theta dee T, that's the rate of change of theta,

33
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:02,580
我可以写一个这样的表达式。
I can write an expression like this.

34
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:07,240
这是什么，是一般旋转矩阵的时间导数。
What this is, is a time derivative of a general rotation matrix.

35
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:13,569
围绕向量L的θ的旋转等于计算的偏斜对称矩阵
A rotation of theta about the vector L is equal to a skew-symmetric matrix computed

36
00:03:13,569 --> 00:03:18,819
在矢量Omega乘以原始旋转矩阵。
on the vector Omega multiplied by the original rotational matrix.

37
00:03:18,819 --> 00:03:23,850
在这种情况下，欧米茄是角速度矢量。它是角度的变化率
Omega in this case is the angular velocity vector. It is the rate of change of angle

38
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:28,939
乘以旋转发生的矢量方向。
multiplied by the vector direction about which the rotation is occurring.
