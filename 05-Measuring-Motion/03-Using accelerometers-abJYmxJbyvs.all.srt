1
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:07,120
为了使它变得有形，我们将考虑我的手机的例子。
To make it tangible, we are going to consider the example of my mobile phone.

2
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:11,990
我要做的第一件事是将一个右手坐标框架附加到它上面
First thing I am going to do is to attach a right handed coordinate frame to it and

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:14,880
我将从屏幕的表面取出z轴。
I am going to have the z-axis out of the face of the screen.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,850
y轴在手机上垂直向上，x轴从左到右水平
The y-axis is vertically upwards on the phone and the x-axis is horizontal from left to

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:21,850
对。
right.

6
00:00:21,850 --> 00:00:26,710
我打算称这个框架B代表车身框架或车身固定框架。
I am going to call this frame B and that stands for the body frame or the body-fixed frame.

7
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:31,570
这是航空航天和机器人技术中非常常见的符号。
This is a very common notation in aerospace and also in robotics.

8
00:00:31,570 --> 00:00:36,960
现在我们要将一个加速度计与我们拥有的每个轴对齐
Now we are going to place one accelerometer aligned with each of the axes that we have

9
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:37,960
附在电话上。
attached to the phone.

10
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:43,360
因此，一个加速度计将处于XB方向，一个处于YB方向，一个处于XB方向
So, one accelerometer would be in XB direction and one in the YB direction and one in the

11
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:44,860
ZB方向。
ZB direction.

12
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:48,180
现代手机充满了惯性传感器。
Modern mobile phones, are packed full of inertial sensors.

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:53,540
它们包含三个加速度计，三个陀螺仪和三个磁力计。
They contained three accelerometers, three gyros and three magnetometers.

14
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:57,739
就像我们在本系列讲座中谈到的其他内容一样，我们将附上
Like everything else that we've talked about in this lecture series, we are going to attach

15
00:00:57,739 --> 00:00:59,430
电话的坐标框架。
a coordinate frame to the phone.

16
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,761
您必须深入了解文档才能找到坐标框架
You have to look reasonably deeply into the documentation to find the coordinate frame

17
00:01:03,761 --> 00:01:09,049
手机的惯例，但对于像这样的iPhone，惯例是x轴
conventions for the phone, but for an iPhone like this, the convention is the x-axis is

18
00:01:09,049 --> 00:01:14,310
在右边，y轴是手机的顶部，而z轴是在手机的顶部
to the right and the y-axis is to the top of the phone and the z-axis is out of the

19
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:15,310
屏幕。
screen.

20
00:01:15,310 --> 00:01:19,909
所以，我打算将一个标准坐标框架固定到手机上，这样我们才能理解它是什么
So, I am going to fix one of my standard coordinate frames to the phone, so we understand what's

21
00:01:19,909 --> 00:01:22,409
什么。
what.

22
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:26,319
您可以为手机获取许多应用程序，报告加速度测量
There are many apps that you can get for your phone, that report the acceleration measurement

23
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:29,250
由手机内置的传感器记录。
recorded by the sensors built into the phone itself.

24
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:33,529
不幸的是，许多这些应用都带来了负面信号。
Unfortunately, many of these apps introduce a negative sign.

25
00:01:33,529 --> 00:01:38,350
这意味着如果手机平放在桌子上，它会报告减去的值
That means that if the phone is sitting flat on the table, it reports a value of minus

26
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:44,520
1G在负z或向下与方向，但正如我们在上一节中讨论的，
1G in the negative z or down with the direction but as we discussed in the previous section,

27
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:49,799
平放在桌子上的设备的加速度应该是正向上的1G
acceleration of a device sitting flat on a table should be 1G in the positive upward

28
00:01:49,799 --> 00:01:50,799
x方向。
x direction.

29
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,989
所以，在这里我们有铅锤，它在重力作用下垂下，所以它是
So, here we have the plumb bob, which is hanging down under the force of gravity, so it is

30
00:01:56,989 --> 00:02:02,560
与重力加速度平行对齐，具有相同的重力加速度
aligned parallel to the gravitational acceleration with the same gravitational acceleration is

31
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,999
平行于z轴。
parallel to the z-axis.

32
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:09,179
如果我像这样旋转手机，那么现在，重力加速度是平行的
If I rotate the phone like this, so now, the gravitational acceleration is parallel to

33
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:14,230
y轴，现在我可以旋转手机，所以重力加速度是平行的
the y-axis and now I can rotate the phone, so the gravitational acceleration is parallel

34
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,540
到x轴。
to the x-axis.

35
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,650
现在让我们考虑一下确定电话方向的问题
Let us consider now the problem of determining the orientation of the phone with respect

36
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:22,920
世界坐标系。
to a world coordinate frame.

37
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,080
此处的世界坐标系显示为蓝色，其原点显示为z轴
The world coordinate frame is shown here in blue and its origin shows that the z-axis

38
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:31,140
向上并平行于重力矢量。
is upwards and parallel to the gravity vector.

39
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:35,459
框架B，车身框架牢固地连接到手机。
Frame B, the body frame is attached rigidly to the phone.

40
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:41,730
现在我可以根据世界坐标为手机的方向写一个表达式
Now I can write an expression for the orientation of the phone with respect to the world coordinate

41
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:46,920
框架和我将在连续的偏航，俯仰和滚转角度方面做到这一点
frame and I will do that in terms of yaw, pitch and roll angles which are successive

42
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,030
围绕z轴，y轴然后是x轴的旋转。
rotations about the z-axis, the y-axis and then the x-axis.

43
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:56,740
这是世界框架中的重力加速度，因为世界的z轴是
This is the gravitational acceleration in the world frame because the world z-axis is

44
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:00,560
平行于重力加速度矢量。
parallel to the gravitational acceleration vector.

45
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:02,640
我们在这里注意到G是正面的。
We note here that G is positive.

46
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,739
我们所说的世界框架中的加速度是G向上的方向。
We are talking about acceleration in the world frame is G in the upward direction.

47
00:03:07,739 --> 00:03:14,019
相对于世界框架旋转这种重力加速度非常容易
It is very easy to rotate this gravitational acceleration with respect to the world frame

48
00:03:14,019 --> 00:03:16,200
进入车身框架。
into the body frame.

49
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,900
这就是手机中的传感器实际测量的内容。
This is what the sensors in the phone actually measure.

50
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:24,150
他们正在测量相对于框架B的重力。值得注意的是
They are measuring gravity with respect to frame B. It is really important to note that

51
00:03:24,150 --> 00:03:26,950
这假设手机没有加速。
this assumes that the phone is not accelerating.

52
00:03:26,950 --> 00:03:30,310
身体上唯一的加速度是由于重力引起的。
The only acceleration on the body is that due to gravity.

53
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:34,709
现在，我可以扩展右侧，我可以用左侧替换
Now, I can expand out the right hand side and I can replace the left hand side with

54
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:37,909
通过手机中的传感器实际测量的重力。
the gravity actually measured by the sensors in the phone.

55
00:03:37,909 --> 00:03:40,870
我有一个非常简单的矢量方程。
I have a very simple vector equation.

56
00:03:40,870 --> 00:03:43,340
如果我在这个向量方程中取第一行。
If I take the first row in this vector equation.

57
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:49,140
我可以重新排列它以获得俯仰角θ的解决方案。
I can rearrange it to get a solution for the pitch angle theta.

58
00:03:49,140 --> 00:03:53,760
如果我取向量方程中最后两行的商，我得到这个表达式
If I take the quotient of the last two rows in the vector equation, I get this expression

59
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:56,379
对于手机的滚动角度。
for the roll angle of the phone.

60
00:03:56,379 --> 00:04:01,879
基于测量的加速度的两个非常简单的方程给出了滚转角和俯仰角
Two very simple equations based on the measured acceleration give me the roll and pitch angle

61
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:05,590
相对于世界坐标系的手机
of the phone with respect to the world coordinate frame.

62
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,560
然后你在这个等式中注意到没有出现偏航角。
Then you note in this equation that yaw angle does not appear.

63
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,040
一个简单的方法来思考为什么会这样，重力矢量有三个
A simple way to think about why this is the case, is that the gravity vector has got three

64
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:20,370
元素但其长度是固定的，因此我们只能通过两条信息来定义它。
elements but its length is fixed therefore we can define it by only two pieces of information.

65
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,729
重力矢量的第三个元素是多余的。
The third element of the gravity vector is redundant.

66
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:28,289
在这种情况下，我们需要的两条信息是侧倾角和俯仰角
In this case, the two pieces of information that we need are the roll angle and the pitch

67
00:04:28,289 --> 00:04:29,289
角度。
angle.

68
00:04:29,289 --> 00:04:30,699
我们不需要偏航角。
We do not need the yaw angle.

69
00:04:30,699 --> 00:04:35,000
为了测量偏航角，我们需要使用不同的传感器，实际上是传感器
To measure the yaw angle, we need to use a different sensor and that sensor is actually

70
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,050
罗盘，这是我们下一节的主题。
a compass and that is the topic of our next section.

71
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:43,639
当我们使用三个加速度计时，一个重要的考虑因素是它仅测量两个
An important consideration when we use three accelerometers, is that it measures only two

72
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:45,139
自变量。
independent variables.

73
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:50,250
矢量的长度是固定的，因此，我们可以简单地描述该矢量
The length of the vector is fixed, so therefore, we can describe that vector just in terms

74
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:51,250
两个角度。
of two angles.

75
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,950
当手机配置如此时，我们可以非常清楚地看到。
We can see that very clearly when the phone is configured like this.

76
00:04:55,950 --> 00:04:59,020
Z和X方向的零加速度。
Zero acceleration in the Z and the X directions.

77
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,370
加速度全部在Y方向。
The acceleration is all in the Y direction.

78
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:07,130
所以加速计的测量结果与这样的手机完全相同，
So the accelerometer measurements are exactly the same with the phone orientated like this,

79
00:05:07,130 --> 00:05:09,150
或者像这样或者像这样。
or like this or like this.

80
00:05:09,150 --> 00:05:13,860
它完全没有区别。
It makes absolutely no difference.

81
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:17,039
如今的加速度计成本非常低，但性能非常非常高。
Accelerometers today have very low cost but very, very high in performance.

82
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:21,889
部分原因是它们大量生产。
Part of the reason for this is that they are manufactured in enormous quantities.

83
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:24,500
它们用于触发汽车安全气囊。
They're use to trigger airbags in cars.

84
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:28,730
它们被用在数码相机中，以确定相机是横向还是纵向
They're used in digital cameras to work out whether the camera is in landscape or portrait

85
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:29,730
模式。
mode.

86
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:33,669
它们在手机中用于各种不同的应用程序，并且它们正在使用
They're used in your phone for all sorts of different applications and they're use the

87
00:05:33,669 --> 00:05:39,129
从像这样的低成本玩具稳定车辆的无人区域到更多
stabilization of unmanned area of vehicles from low cost toys like this to much more

88
00:05:39,129 --> 00:05:40,580
复杂的系统。
sophisticated systems.
