1
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:08,330
让我们总结一下我们在本次讲座中谈到的一些要点。
Let's summarize some of the points that we’ve talked about in this lecture.

2
00:00:08,330 --> 00:00:12,410
今天我们理所当然地认为我们可以使用GPS来确定我们在任何地方的位置
Today we take for granted that we can use GPS to determine our position anywhere on

3
00:00:12,410 --> 00:00:18,179
这个星球的表面，但它是一种相对较新的技术。它才开始运作
the surface of the planet, but it is a relatively recent technology. It only became operational

4
00:00:18,179 --> 00:00:25,439
在1994年，只有在2000年才能以合理的准确度为公众提供。
in 1994, and only became available at reasonable accuracy for the general public in the year 2000.

5
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,359
在GPS出现之前，精确地在行星表面或外太空中导航
Before the advent of GPS, navigating precisely on the surface of the planet or in outer space

6
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,679
非常困难，使用的技术称为惯性导航，
was very very difficult, and the technology that was used was called inertial navigation,

7
00:00:36,679 --> 00:00:41,489
这包括测量车辆的加速度和角速度，并进行积分
and that involved measuring the acceleration and angular velocity of a vehicle, and integrating

8
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:44,510
随着时间的推移确定位置。
that over time to determine the position.

9
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:49,350
惯性导航系统的关键部件是：惯性测量单元;
The key components of an Inertial Navigation System are: an inertial measurement unit;

10
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:54,260
它包含测量加速度，磁场和角速度的传感器
which contains the sensors that measure acceleration, magnetic field, and angular velocity, and

11
00:00:54,260 --> 00:00:58,320
什么叫做航位推算软件;它接收那些信号并将它们集成在一起
what’s called dead reckoning software; that takes those signals and integrates them over

12
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,309
时间不断更新车辆的姿势。
time to continually update the pose of the vehicle.

13
00:01:02,309 --> 00:01:07,360
在简单的水平上，我们可以认为加速度计是弹簧内部的质量
At a simplistic level we can consider that an accelerometer is a mass on a spring inside

14
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,299
一个小盒子。如果我们做代数，我们可以证明弹簧的延伸是线性的
a little box. If we do the algebra we can show that the extension of the spring is linearly

15
00:01:12,299 --> 00:01:17,770
与装置的加速度和重力加速度成比例。加速度计
proportional to the acceleration of the device and the gravitational acceleration. An accelerometer

16
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:24,680
静止在地球上表示在垂直或向上方向上加速1g。
at rest on earth indicates an acceleration of 1g in the vertical or upward direction.

17
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:28,759
这有点违反直觉，因为当我们放弃某些东西时它会加速
This is a little bit counter-intuitive, because when we drop something it is going to accelerate

18
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:34,159
在向下的方向。静止加速度计向上测量1g。这是一个
in the downward direction. The accelerometer at rest measures 1g upwards. And this is a

19
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,259
等价原则的结果。地球表面的加速度计
consequence of the equivalence principle. An accelerometer on the surface of the earth

20
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:45,610
或安装在火箭上的加速度计以1g向上加速，两者都表示加速度
or an accelerometer mounted in a rocket accelerating upwards at 1g, both of them indicate an acceleration

21
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:47,180
1克
of 1g.

22
00:01:47,180 --> 00:01:52,369
许多设备，例如我的手机，包含三个测量加速度的加速度计
Many devices, for example my phone, contain three accelerometers which measure acceleration

23
00:01:52,369 --> 00:01:58,890
在连接到我的手机的坐标系B的x，y和z方向上。我可以使用
in the x, y and z directions of a coordinate frame B attached to my phone. I can use the

24
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:03,960
在坐标系B中测量手机中加速度的分量来确定
components of acceleration measured in the phone in coordinate frame B to determine the

25
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:09,030
相对于蓝色坐标系0，手机的滚动和俯仰。
roll and pitch of the phone with respect to the blue coordinate frame 0.

26
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:13,940
地球包含一个巨大但相当弱的磁铁，但磁铁的磁极不是
The earth contains a gigantic but fairly weak magnet, but the poles of that magnet are not

27
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,700
不变。它们随着时间而变化。指南针有一个指向北方的针
constant. They change with time. A compass has a needle which points towards the north

28
00:02:18,700 --> 00:02:23,800
磁极，但北极磁极与北极地理极不同。
magnetic pole, but the north magnetic pole is different to the north geographic pole.

29
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,480
在地球表面的任何特定点，我们都可以建立一个右撇子
At any particular point on the surface of the earth we can establish a right-handed

30
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,920
坐标框架，其中一个轴指向北地理极点，另一个轴指向
coordinate frame where one axis points towards the north geographic pole, another axis points

31
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:37,000
垂直向下朝向行星的中心，另一个轴指向行星的中心
vertically downwards towards the centre of the planet, and the other axis points in the

32
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,690
地理东方向。地球的磁场矢量在这里用红色箭头表示，
geographic east direction. The earth’s magnetic field vector is shown here by a red arrow,

33
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:47,660
并且可以通过两个角度来描述该坐标系。磁偏角
and it can be described with respect to this coordinate frame by two angles. Magnetic declination

34
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,800
是两个方向之间的差异;真正的北方向和方向
is the difference between two directions; the direction of true north and the direction

35
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:56,880
磁北极-指南针指向的方向。另一角是磁性的
of magnetic north - the direction that the compass points in. The other angle is magnetic

36
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:01,620
倾斜，这是磁场矢量相对于的角度
inclination, and that’s the angle that the magnetic field vector makes with respect to

37
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:07,260
局部水平面。它也被称为磁浸。
a local horizontal surface. It’s also referred to as magnetic dip.

38
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:11,130
为了确定偏航角-这是身体面向的方向
In order to determine the yaw angle - that’s the direction that the body is facing with

39
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:16,150
尊重磁北-我们需要结合两个传感器的信息。我们确定
respect to magnetic north - we need to combine information from two sensors. We determine

40
00:03:16,150 --> 00:03:21,350
使用加速度计的车身侧倾角和俯仰角，然后我们使用这些组件
the roll and pitch angle of the body using the accelerometers, and then we use the components

41
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:27,080
在身体上感知的磁场，将其与我们对当地的了解相结合
of the magnetic field sensed onboard the body, combine that with what we know about the local

42
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,440
磁倾角和局部磁场强度来确定偏航
magnetic inclination angle, and the local magnetic field strength to determine the yaw

43
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:33,270
角度。
angle.

44
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:38,170
旋转盘具有一些有趣的动态特性。其中之一是我们可以使用
A spinning disc has some interesting dynamic properties. One of these is that we can use

45
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:44,490
它将角速度-欧米茄-绕蓝轴转换成扭矩-tau
it to convert an angular velocity - omega - about the blue axis, into a torque - tau

46
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,770
-关于红轴。
- about the red axis.

47
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:51,160
我们可以通过测量施加在支撑轴上的力来测量该扭矩
We can measure that torque by measuring the forces that are exerted on the axle that supports

48
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,210
旋转的圆盘。如果我们知道诸如盘的转动惯量之类的参数
the rotating disc. If we know the parameters such as the rotational inertia of the disc

49
00:03:56,210 --> 00:04:01,040
和盘的旋转速度，然后我们可以确定欧米茄，旋转速度
and the rotational velocity of the disc, then we can determine omega, the rotational velocity

50
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,080
这种陀螺仪传感器。
of this gyroscopic sensor.

51
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,160
有趣的是，我们的身体中存在加速度计和陀螺仪的生物等价物。
Interestingly there are biological equivalents of accelerometers and gyroscopes in our bodies.

52
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:14,660
在我们的每个耳朵中，我们有两个加速度计和三个测量运动的陀螺仪
In each of our ears we have two accelerometers and three gyroscopes which measure the motion

53
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:19,410
我们的身体，这与我们大脑中的视觉信息相结合，以便了解
of our body, and that’s integrated with visual information in our brain to understand

54
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:22,090
我们如何走向世界。
how we are moving with respect to the world.

55
00:04:22,090 --> 00:04:27,080
最后，我们研究了如何计算旋转矩阵的导数。这是它的产物
Finally we looked at how to compute the derivative of a rotation matrix. It’s the product of

56
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:33,120
两个矩阵：它是一个偏斜对称矩阵乘以原始旋转矩阵。
two matrices: it’s a skew-symmetric matrix multiplied by the original rotation matrix.

57
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:37,860
斜对称矩阵是根据身体的角速度计算出来的;那就是
The skew-symmetric matrix is computed on the angular velocity of the body; that’s the

58
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:43,930
矢量L关于身体瞬间旋转乘以旋转速度
vector L about which the body is instantaneously rotating multiplied by the rate of rotation

59
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:45,629
关于那个轴。
about that axis.

60
00:04:45,629 --> 00:04:50,120
斜对称矩阵具有许多有趣的属性。特别是它
The skew-symmetric matrix has got a number of interesting properties. In particular it’s

61
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:54,909
单数。也就是说，它的确定值总是等于0，它的转置是负数
singular. That is, its determinate is always equal to 0, and its transpose is the negative

62
00:04:54,909 --> 00:05:01,110
自身的价值。在三维的情况下，如此处所示，我们可以清楚地看到零对角线，
value of itself. In the case of three dimensions, as shown here, we can clearly see a zero diagonal,

63
00:05:01,110 --> 00:05:06,199
以及矩阵只包含三个独特元素x，y和z的事实
and the fact that the matrix only contains three unique elements, x, y and z, Each of

64
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:09,120
出现一次带有正号，一次出现负号。
which appear once with a positive sign, and once with a negative sign.
