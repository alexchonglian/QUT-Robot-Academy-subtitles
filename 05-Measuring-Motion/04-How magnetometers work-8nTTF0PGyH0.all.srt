00:00:03,850 --> 00:00:08,420
在本节中，我们将讨论测量磁场。一个简单而且
In this section, we’re going to talk about measuring the magnetic field. A simple and

2
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:14,010
熟悉的磁场传感器类型是磁罗盘。指南针被发现了
familiar type of magnetic field sensor is the magnetic compass. The compass was discovered

3
00:00:14,010 --> 00:00:19,740
由中国人在2000多年前。它包含一个与之对齐的磁化针
by the Chinese over 2,000 years ago. It contains a magnetized needle that aligns with the

4
00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:24,990
地球的磁场。地球围绕穿过北方的轴旋转
Earth’s magnetic field. The Earth rotates about an axis that passes through the North

5
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:31,070
南地理极点。地球本身是一个巨大的磁铁和北方和南方
and South geographic poles. The Earth itself is a gigantic magnet and the North and South

6
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:37,149
磁铁的磁极不对应地球的北极和南极地理极点。
poles of the magnet do not correspond to the North and South geographic poles of the Earth.

7
00:00:37,149 --> 00:00:42,319
我们可以想象这个巨大的内部磁铁传出的磁场线
We can imagine the magnetic field lines from this giant internal magnet passing out of

8
00:00:42,319 --> 00:00:46,449
行星表面，穿过太空，然后潜入地面
the surface of the planet, arcing through space, and then diving back in to the ground

9
00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:51,069
在北磁极。我拿着的红色箭头代表
at the North magnetic pole. The red arrow that I’m holding represents

10
00:00:51,069 --> 00:00:55,510
大约是地球的一个磁场线。我们可以把这些想象成想象的
approximately one of the Earth’s magnetic field lines. We can think of these as imaginary

11
00:00:55,510 --> 00:01:01,049
从地球出来的线，穿过天空，再次降落在北极
lines which come out of the Earth, arc through the sky and land again at the North Pole of

12
00:01:01,049 --> 00:01:07,299
星球。现在，我通过测量地球的三个组成部分来对齐这个箭头
the planet. Now, I have aligned this arrow by measuring the three components of the Earth’s

13
00:01:07,299 --> 00:01:11,860
使用我的手机磁场。而且，此刻，我有这个箭头和手机的方式
magnetic field using my phone. And, at the moment, the way I have this arrow and the phone

14
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:17,930
取向，非零的磁场的唯一组成部分是Y方向，即
oriented, the only component of magnetic field that’s non zero is in the Y direction, that’s

15
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:24,740
我的这个方向，在我的手机上。地球的磁极是不断的
the, this direction on my, on my phone. The magnetic poles of the Earth are constantly

16
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:29,880
移动，这对于像指南针指向的传感器来说有点问题
moving and that’s a bit problematic for a sensor like a compass which points at the

17
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,140
磁极。我们需要了解磁极的位置
magnetic poles. We need to understand something about where the magnetic poles are with respect

18
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:39,340
地理极点以及它们如何移动。指南针指向指针
to the geographic poles and how they are moving. The needle of a compass points towards the

19
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:44,979
这个星球的磁北极。但是，真正的北方或地理北方是不同的
Magnetic North Pole of the planet. But, true North or geographic North is in a different

20
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:50,729
方向。在这里，我们有一个右手坐标框架，其中轴指向地理位置
direction. Here, we have a right-handed coordinate frame where the axes are pointing to geographic

21
00:01:50,729 --> 00:01:57,229
北部，地理东部，垂直向下朝向地球的中心。想象一下吧
North, geographic East and vertically down toward the center of the planet. Imagine now

22
00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:03,289
包含磁场矢量的平面，用红色箭头和符号B表示。
a plane that contains the magnetic field vector which is denoted by a red arrow and the symbol B.

23
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:11,180
该平面与地理北方向之间的角度是磁偏角D.
Angle between this plane and the geographic North direction is the magnetic declination angle D.

24
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:14,720
该图显示了磁偏角
This diagram shows magnetic declination for

25
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,000
2010年，我们可以看到它在全球范围内变化很大。磁性
the year 2010 and we can see that it varies quite significantly across the planet. Magnetic

26
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,920
北方可以与真正的北方相差正负20度。这些价值变成了
North can be up to plus or minus 20 degrees away from true North. These values become

27
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,050
我们可以非常清楚地看到南磁极附近非常极端
quite extreme in the vicinity of the South Magnetic Pole which we can see very clearly

28
00:02:30,050 --> 00:02:34,630
这里。如果你正在驾船并且你正在使用航海图，那么适当的磁力
here. If you’re sailing a boat and you’re using a nautical chart, the appropriate magnetic

29
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:40,050
赤纬通常标记在该图表的某处。磁偏角变化
declination is typically marked somewhere on that chart. Magnetic declination varies

30
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:45,420
随着时间的推移，这个引人入胜的视频显示了磁偏角的等高线
over time and this fascinating video shows the contour lines of magnetic declination

31
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:48,280
在数百年的时间里变化。
varying over periods of hundreds of years.

32
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:56,800
磁场线通常不平行于地球表面。
The magnetic field lines are generally not parallel to the surface of the Earth.

33
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,860
在南半球，磁场线
In the Southern Hemisphere, the magnetic field lines

34
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:03,370
走出地面。并且，在北半球，磁场线消失
come out of the ground. And, in the Northern Hemisphere, the magnetic field lines disappear

35
00:03:03,370 --> 00:03:08,910
进入地面。因此，我们可以引入另一个角度，称为磁倾角
into the ground. So, we can introduce another angle which is referred to as magnetic inclination

36
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:14,560
通常用符号I表示并且表示磁场的角度
denoted typically by the symbol I and that represents the angle of the magnetic field

37
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,090
相对于地球表面的线。而且，这是磁倾角的图
line with respect to the surface of the Earth. And, this is a map of magnetic inclination

38
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:25,760
在地球表面。使用的符号约定是北半球中心。因此，如果
over the surface of the planet. The sign convention used is Northern Hemisphere centric. So, if

39
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:30,140
磁场线下降到地面，考虑倾斜角度
the magnetic field line is descending in to the ground, the inclination angle is considered

40
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:34,730
要积极。这是另一张图表，这张图表显示了磁场的强度
to be positive. Here is another chart and this one shows the strength of the magnetic

41
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:40,470
场，磁场矢量的大小，这是纳米特斯拉的单位。那是
field, the magnitude of the magnetic field vector and this is units of nano teslas. That’s

42
00:03:40,470 --> 00:03:46,280
10到特斯拉减9。相比之下，现代MRI机器具有磁场强度
10 to the minus 9 Tesla. For comparison, a modern MRI machine has a magnetic field strength

43
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,370
约4至8特斯拉。这比磁力强十万倍
of around 4 to 8 Tesla. That’s a hundred thousand times stronger than the magnetic

44
00:03:51,370 --> 00:03:52,760
地球的场强。
field strength of the Earth.
