1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,899
正如我们刚才提到的，惯性测量单元的关键元件是传感器
As we just mentioned, the key elements of an inertial measurement unit are sensors that

2
00:00:07,899 --> 00:00:12,950
测量加速度，磁场和角速度。现在，我们要谈谈
measure acceleration, magnetic field and angular velocity. Now, we’re going to talk about

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:15,140
我们如何测量加速度。
how we measure acceleration.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:19,699
我在这里面前的是所谓的四旋翼飞行器。这是一个飞行机器人。
What I have in front of me here is what’s called a quadrotor. It is a flying robot.

5
00:00:19,699 --> 00:00:24,939
它有四个螺旋桨。并且，通过控制各个螺旋桨的速度，我
It’s got four propellers. And, by controlling the speed of the individual propellers, I

6
00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:30,470
可以使机器上，下，左，右等。真的非常重要
can make the machine go up, down, left, right and so on. Really critically important to

7
00:00:30,470 --> 00:00:35,940
在空中控制这样的机器是一种了解它的方向的平衡感
control a machine like this in the air is a sense of balance knowing its orientation

8
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:42,079
在3D空间。因此，它有一个惯性测量单元。所以，在这个大的里面
in 3D space. So, it has an inertial measurement unit on board. So, somewhere inside this large

9
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:48,010
堆叠的电子产品，有一块看起来像这样的板子。该板包含
stack of electronics, there is a board that looks something like this. This board contains

10
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:53,660
三个加速度计，可以确定其在太空中的滚转角和俯仰角。它包含
three accelerometers, which allow it to determine its roll and pitch angle in space. It contains

11
00:00:53,660 --> 00:00:58,789
三个陀螺仪，测量其围绕三个正交轴的旋转速度。和，
three gyroscopes which measure its rotational velocity around three orthogonal axis. And,

12
00:00:58,789 --> 00:01:04,640
它包含一个三轴磁力计，因此它可以确定它的方向
it contains a three-axis magnetometer, so it can determine its orientation where it’s

13
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,950
朝向地球的磁场前进。
heading with respect to the Earth’s magnetic field.

14
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:14,270
现在，这个小板是为这个特殊的四旋翼飞机定制的。商业产品
Now, this little board is customised for this particular quadrotor. A commercial product

15
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:20,510
执行完全相同功能的是这样的设备。它有一个插入的USB端口
that performs exactly the same function is a device like this. It's got a USB port that plugs

16
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:25,010
进入计算机，但在内部，它包含三个加速度计，三个陀螺仪，和
in to a computer, but internally, it contains three accelerometers, three gyroscopes, and

17
00:01:25,010 --> 00:01:31,950
三个磁力计。现在，这个相同的功能几乎以非常紧凑的形式存在
three magnetometers. Now, this same functionality exists in very compact form inside almost

18
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,290
所有现代智能手机。而且，这可以实现智能手机指南针的应用
all modern smartphones. And, this enables the smartphone compass application so it can

19
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:43,170
找到北方，它可以确定滚转角和俯仰角。它有时用于游戏控制等。
find north, it can determine roll and pitch angles. It’s sometimes used for game control and so on.

20
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,240
想象一下，我站在电梯或电梯里，我有一个非常简单的
Imagine now that I’m standing in a lift or an elevator, and I’ve got a very simple

21
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,960
我身体的动力模型。它由坐在弹簧上的大众组成。质量代表
dynamical model for my body. It consists of a mass sitting on a spring. The mass represents

22
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:59,130
我的身体的质量位于我的中心质量点，它坐在一个弹簧上
the mass of my body situated at a point at my centre mass and it’s sitting on a spring

23
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:05,270
这代表了我下半身和腿部的柔软。现在，随着电梯的启动
which represents the softness of my lower body and my legs. Now, as the lift starts

24
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:10,610
向上移动，我们感觉暂时更重，那就是重量压在弹簧上。
to move upwards, we feel momentarily heavier, that is the weight pushes down on the spring.

25
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:15,940
而且，当电梯停下来时，我们感觉暂时更轻，这是因为
And, as the lift comes to a stop, we feel momentarily lighter and this is because of

26
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:20,530
惯性效应。这意味着它想要保持其当前的速度。所以，当我们
inertial effect. It means that it wants to maintain its current velocity. So, when we

27
00:02:20,530 --> 00:02:26,220
开始时，它想保持原来的0速度，这就是导致它的原因
start off, it wants to maintain its original 0 velocity and that’s what causes it to

28
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,910
落后于升降机的人。并且，它压缩了弹簧，它使它们成为现实
lag behind the person moving up in a lift. And, that compresses the spring, it make them

29
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:32,810
感觉更重。
feel heavier.

30
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:37,420
随着升力减速，重量想要保持在垂直速度
As the lift slows down, the weight wants to keep going at the vertical velocity of the

31
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:42,210
升力导致弹簧伸展，使我们感觉轻一点。
lift and that causes that spring to extend and causes us to feel a little bit lighter.

32
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:47,090
这是一个小型的现代惯性测量单元，这种类型非常常用
Here is a small modern inertial measurement unit, the type that’s quite commonly used

33
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:53,230
在各种机器人系统中。小盒子里面有许多传感器，包括
in a variety of robot systems. Inside the little box are a number of sensors including

34
00:02:53,230 --> 00:03:00,290
加速度计。那么，让我们看看盒子内部，看看加速度计的工作原理。和，
accelerometers. So, let’s look inside the box and see how an accelerometer works. And,

35
00:03:00,290 --> 00:03:05,990
它看起来就像我们之前研究的例子。它包含一个质量和一个弹簧。如
it looks just like the example we studied before. It contains a mass and a spring. As

36
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:11,500
加速度计的主体向上加速，重量延伸弹簧。和，
the body of the accelerometer accelerates upwards, the weight extends the spring. And,

37
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:17,510
当加速度计减速时，弹簧将重量向上拉。所以，扩展
as the accelerometer decelerates, the spring pulls the weight upwards. So, the extension

38
00:03:17,510 --> 00:03:23,170
弹簧的角度与加速度计的主体的加速度线性相关。这是
of the spring is linearly related to the acceleration of the body of the accelerometer. This is

39
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:28,330
所有加速度传感装置的基本原理。
the fundamental principle underpinning all acceleration sensing devices.

40
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:34,230
让我们看看盒子内部，再一次，我们看到一个弹簧和一个质量。群众经常
Let’s look inside the box and, once again, we see a spring and a mass. The mass is often

41
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:39,520
被称为证明质量。而且，在这个例子中，它的质量为m和扩展
referred to as the proof mass. And, in this example, it’s got a mass of m and the extension

42
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:44,740
弹簧的符号用符号x表示。现在，我要标记质心
of the spring is denoted by the symbol x. Now, I’m going to mark the center of mass

43
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:49,800
证据质量及其相对于地面的位移，我将表示它
of the proof mass and its displacement with respect to the ground, I’m going to denote it

44
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:54,790
由xm。并且，加速度计的主体的位移，我将表示
by xm. And, the displacement of the body of the accelerometer, I’m going to denote by

45
00:03:54,790 --> 00:04:00,860
符号xb。而且，身体的加速度等于xb双点，我可以
the symbol xb. And, so the acceleration of the body is equal to xb double dot and I can

46
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:07,150
写一个xm，xb和x之间的关系。作用在检测质量上的弹簧力，
write a relationship between xm, xb and x. The spring force acting on the proof mass,

47
00:04:07,150 --> 00:04:12,459
我将打电话给fs，作用于检验质量的重力是质量乘以
I’m going to call fs, and the gravity force acting on the proof mass is the mass multiplied

48
00:04:12,459 --> 00:04:18,870
通过重力加速度g。我可以写出牛顿第二定律，它涉及加速度
by gravitational acceleration g. I can write Newton’s second law which relates the acceleration

49
00:04:18,870 --> 00:04:25,009
质量对两个力作用在弹簧力向上和重力向下作用。
of the mass to the two forces acting on at the spring force upwards and gravity acting downwards.

50
00:04:25,009 --> 00:04:29,090
而且，对于弹簧，我们知道力与弹簧的伸展成正比，
And, for a spring, we know that the force is proportional to the extension of the spring,

51
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:33,919
我们可以想象，当x增加时，我正在伸展弹簧，它向上拉
and we can imagine that as x increases, I’m extending the spring and it is pulling upwards

52
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,930
越来越大的力量。现在，我们可以结合这些方程并做一点
with a greater and greater force. Now, we can combine these equations and do a little

53
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:43,669
重新排列和简化。而现在，我能写出一个表达式
bit of rearrangement and simplification. And now, I’m able to write an expression that

54
00:04:43,669 --> 00:04:49,939
将弹簧x的延伸与主体的加速度a和重力相关联
relates the extension of the spring, x, to the acceleration of the body, a, and the gravitational

55
00:04:49,939 --> 00:04:55,249
加速度，g。值得注意的是，它无法区分它们，这一点非常重要
acceleration, g. It’s really important to note that it cannot tell the difference between

56
00:04:55,249 --> 00:05:00,889
加速身体，a或重力加速度，g，这是我们要做的
acceleration of the body, a, or gravitational acceleration, g, and this is something we’ll

57
00:05:00,889 --> 00:05:03,680
过了一会儿。
return to in just a moment.

58
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,279
每个加速度计都有一个敏感的方向，通常标记在身体上
Every accelerometer has a sensitive direction and, typically, that’s marked on the body

59
00:05:08,279 --> 00:05:12,809
加速度计包的。现在，在这个特定的例子中，加速度计测量
of the accelerometer package. Now, in this particular example, the accelerometer measures

60
00:05:12,809 --> 00:05:18,009
在垂直方向上加速，但它对水平加速度不敏感
acceleration in the vertical direction, but it is insensitive to acceleration in the horizontal

61
00:05:18,009 --> 00:05:23,180
方向或在屏幕外的方向。如果我把加速度计放在某个地方休息
direction or in the direction out of the screen. If I place an accelerometer at rest somewhere

62
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:29,050
在地球表面，加速度计在垂直方向上记录1g的加速度
on the surface of the Earth, the accelerometer records an acceleration of 1g in the vertical

63
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:34,279
或向上方向，这有点不直观。如果我放弃一些东西，它就会发生
or upward direction and this is a little bit unintuitive. If I drop something, it’s going

64
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:39,949
加速度计在垂直方向上测量1g，向下加速
to accelerate in the downward direction that the accelerometer measures 1g in the vertical

65
00:05:39,949 --> 00:05:46,270
或向上的方向。而且，这是爱因斯坦等效原则的结果。
or upward direction. And, this is a consequence of Einstein’s Equivalence Principle.

66
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:51,680
并且，就加速度计而言，这两个示例完全相同。该
And, these two examples are exactly the same as far as an accelerometer is concerned. The

67
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,249
加速度计坐在地球表面，或者如果它坐在火箭中
accelerometer is sitting on the surface of planet Earth, or if it is sitting in a rocket

68
00:05:56,249 --> 00:06:01,860
正在加速向上1克。在这两种情况下，加速度计都会注册
which is accelerating upwards at 1g. In both these cases, the accelerometer will register

69
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:08,889
在垂直方向上加速1g。重力加速度各不相同
an acceleration of 1g in the vertical direction. Gravitational acceleration varies across the

70
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:14,430
地球表面。地球不是一个完美的球体。它略微压扁，所以直径
surface of the Earth. The Earth is not a perfect sphere. It’s slightly squashed, so the diameter

71
00:06:14,430 --> 00:06:19,460
在赤道处大于通过极点测量的直径。因为这，
at the equator is greater than the diameter measured through the poles. Because of this,

72
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:23,479
站在赤道上的人离地球中心更远。
somebody who is standing at the equator is further away from the center of the Earth.

73
00:06:23,479 --> 00:06:28,749
因此，他们经历了较低的重力加速度。所以，我们可以很清楚地看到
So, therefore, they experience a lower gravitational acceleration. So, we can see quite clearly

74
00:06:28,749 --> 00:06:34,680
在这个图中，赤道带的重力加速度明显较低
in this figure here, the gravitational acceleration in the equatorial band is significantly lower

75
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:39,839
而不是地球温带和极地地区的重力加速度。
than gravitational acceleration in the temperate and Polar Regions of the Earth.

76
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:47,520
标准重力值取为每秒9.80665米的平方，但请注意重要值
The standard gravity value is taken as 9.80665 meters per second squared, but note the significant

77
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:52,430
变化取决于你在哪里。您拥有的低成本加速度计
variation depending on where you are. The low cost accelerometers that you have in your

78
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:57,139
手机也许在你车内的导航系统中都是基于微电子机械
phone and perhaps in the navigation system in your car are based on micro-electromechanical

79
00:06:57,139 --> 00:07:02,509
系统技术和整个器件都是用硅蚀刻出来的。惯性质量或
system technology and the whole device is etched out of silicon. The inertial mass or

80
00:07:02,509 --> 00:07:08,309
弹性腿支撑着质量块。在水平加速的情况下，
proof mass is supported by flexible spring legs. In the case of horizontal acceleration,

81
00:07:08,309 --> 00:07:14,110
惯性质量将向侧面移动。而且，位置的变化是有能力的
the inertial mass will move sideways. And, the change in position is measured capacititively

82
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:20,029
在这里使用这些传感器能够测量三个加速度非常有用
using these sensors here. It’s really useful to be able to measure acceleration in three

83
00:07:20,029 --> 00:07:25,229
正交方向与右手坐标的x，y和z轴对齐
orthogonal directions aligned with the x, y and z-axis of a right-handed coordinate

84
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:32,319
帧。今天，您可以购买三轴加速度计作为单个芯片。它包含三个MEMS加速度计
frame. Today, you can buy tri-axial accelerometers as a single chip. It contains three MEMS accelerometer

85
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:38,419
传感器，电子设备，模数转换器，滤波器和串行IO功能
sensors, electronics, analog to digital converters, filters and a serial IO capability so that

86
00:07:38,419 --> 00:07:42,369
您可以非常轻松地将其连接到微控制器。
you can very easily connect it to a microcontroller.

87
00:07:42,369 --> 00:07:47,509
你可能没有意识到你脑子里有加速度计。在内耳组件中
You may not be aware that you have accelerometers in your head. In the inner ear assembly in

88
00:07:47,509 --> 00:07:52,949
我们每只耳朵都有一对加速度计。而且，这些基础的物理原理
each of our ears, there are a pair of accelerometers. And, the physical principles underlying these

89
00:07:52,949 --> 00:07:57,339
生物加速度计与我们已经讨论过的相同。
biological accelerometers are just the same as those we’ve already been talking about.

90
00:07:57,339 --> 00:08:02,559
检验质量是一堆碳酸钙晶体，它们被称为耳石，
The proof mass is a bunch of calcium carbonate crystals and they are referred to as otoliths,

91
00:08:02,559 --> 00:08:07,559
这意味着字面上的耳石。它们坐在凝胶状的膜上
which means literally ear stones. They are sitting on a gelatinous membrane which serves

92
00:08:07,559 --> 00:08:12,319
作为春天。并且，嵌入在凝胶状膜中的是一堆毛细胞和它们
as the spring. And, embedded in that gelatinous membrane are a bunch of hair cells and they

93
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,589
测量耳石相对于内耳的位移。我们有两个
measure the displacement of the otoliths with respect to the inner ear. We have two of these

94
00:08:17,589 --> 00:08:21,349
每只耳朵中的加速度计，一个称为utricle，一个称为saccule。
accelerometers in each ear, one is called the utricle and one is called the saccule.

95
00:08:21,349 --> 00:08:25,960
并且，它们几乎是正交的，因此可以感知水平方向的加速度
And, they are oriented almost orthogonally, so one senses the acceleration in the horizontal

96
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:29,789
方向，并且感知垂直方向上的加速度。
direction, and one senses the acceleration in the vertical direction.

97
00:08:29,789 --> 00:08:34,680
当你改变头部的方向时，来自utricle的加速度信号
As you change the orientation of your head, the acceleration signals from the utricle

98
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,589
并且球囊变化并且允许您的大脑确定关于取向的某事
and the saccule vary and allows your brain to determine something about the orientation

99
00:08:39,589 --> 00:08:43,190
你的头部相对于世界坐标系。
of your head with respect to the world coordinate frame.
