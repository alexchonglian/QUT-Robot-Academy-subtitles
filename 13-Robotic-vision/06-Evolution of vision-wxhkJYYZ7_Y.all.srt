1
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:08,230
因此，生命大约在36亿年前出现在地球上。但对于大部分
So life appeared on planet earth about 3.6 billion years ago. But for the bulk of that

2
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:14,650
时间，生物，地球上的生命，是无法看到的。大约5亿年前
time, organisms, life on the planet, was not able to see. Around 500 million years ago

3
00:00:14,650 --> 00:00:19,460
生命技术发生了革命，出现了视觉感受
there was a revolution in the technology of life and the sense of vision appeared, and

4
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:27,400
它在许多物种中出现得很快，并且导致了它的多样性
it appeared very quickly across a number of species and it led to a great diversity in

5
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:32,950
生活的方式。所以此时此前5亿年前堪称寒武纪爆发
the forms of life. So at this point 500 million years ago called the Cambrian explosion when

6
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:38,210
突然间，所有这些视觉启用的生命形式开始在地球上漫游。
suddenly all these vision-enabled life forms started to roam the planet.

7
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:43,199
这些生命形式中最早也许是最成功的一种是三叶虫，和
One of the earliest and perhaps most successful of those life forms is the trilobite, and

8
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:49,059
在这里，我有一个化石三叶虫。他们在百万年前出现了500件事并且他们住了
here I have a fossilised trilobite. They appeared 500 something million years ago and they lived

9
00:00:49,059 --> 00:00:56,819
这个星球上有2.7亿年的历史。因此它们是具有分段的动物
on the planet for something like 270 million years. So they are an animal with a segmented

10
00:00:56,819 --> 00:01:04,640
身体和他们有两个相当原始的，按现代标准，复眼。而且感觉
body and they had two fairly primitive, by modern standards, compound eyes. And the sense

11
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:12,330
视力使动物具有竞争优势。如果动物可能会看到另一只动物
of vision gave animals a competitive advantage. If an animal could see another animal, perhaps

12
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:16,850
它是一种狩猎动物，它想捕食其他动物，如果它有一种感觉
it was a hunting animal and it wanted to prey on that other animal, if it had a sense of

13
00:01:16,850 --> 00:01:21,200
愿景它有一个真正的优势，它不仅仅是盲目地碰到它。他可以
vision it had a real advantage, it didn’t just have to blindly bump into it. He can

14
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:25,910
实际上看到那只动物在哪里并追踪并消耗它。如果你是这样的话
actually see where that animal is and go after it and consume it. And similarly if you were

15
00:01:25,910 --> 00:01:30,040
一种猎物，一种有人可能想要吃的动物，如果你有意识的话
a prey animal, the sort of animal that someone might want to eat, then if you had a sense

16
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:34,610
视力和你有眼睛，然后你可以感觉到一个捕食者来了，你可以采取
of vision and you had eyes then you could sense a predator coming and you could take

17
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:41,640
一些回避行动。因此，视野导致了......几乎是地球上的军备竞赛作为掠夺者
some evasive action. So vision led to this… almost an arms race on planet earth as predators

18
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:46,450
和猎物动物获得视觉，他们改善了视觉，直到
and prey animals gain the sense of vision and they improved the sense of vision until

19
00:01:46,450 --> 00:01:52,570
我们今天在非常非常多的动物身上拥有非常复杂的视野。
we have the sort of very sophisticated vision in very, very many animals today.

20
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:59,890
因此，大约5.4亿年前，地球上出现了视觉感。什么时候
So the sense of vision appeared on planet earth about 540 million years ago. And when

21
00:01:59,890 --> 00:02:06,020
它似乎改变了游戏规则。事实上，视觉感觉非常有效，
it appeared it was a game changer. In fact, the sense of vision was so effective that,

22
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:13,420
随着时间的推移，十种不同类型的眼睛设计已经发展。例如，透镜的眼睛
over time, ten different sorts of eye designs have evolved. For instance, the lensed eye

23
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:19,700
我们有，昆虫有复眼，奇怪的反射器为基础的眼睛
that we have, the compound eye that a insect has, the strange reflector based eyes that

24
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:26,390
扇贝有等等。因此，这个星球上有十种不同的眼睛设计。和
scallops have and so on. So there are ten different designs of eyes on the planet. And

25
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:31,990
事实上，与我们所拥有的一样，透镜的眼睛已被发明七次
the lensed eye, like the one we have, has, in fact, been invented seven times across

26
00:02:31,990 --> 00:02:38,560
不同的动物物种和时间。所以对我来说，这些事实认为愿景是
different animal species and across time. So to me these facts argue that vision is

27
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,980
一种非常重要且真正有效的方式来感知周围世界正在发生的事情
a really important and really effective way of sensing what is going on in the world around

28
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:48,209
您。当然，视力需要依旧点亮
you. Now of course vision needs light in order

29
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:54,040
为了操作，我们需要用环境光照亮场景。光子反射自
to operate, we need the scene to be illuminated with ambient light. Photons reflected from

30
00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:00,069
进入我们眼睛的场景，它们落在视网膜上并产生一些神经刺激。绝对
the scene into our eyes, they fall on the retina and create some neural stimulus. Absolutely

31
00:03:00,069 --> 00:03:05,459
必须有光源，但当然我们已经在一个真正的行星上进化了
has to have a source of light, but of course we have evolved on a planet next to a really

32
00:03:05,459 --> 00:03:10,650
明亮的星星。所以光线充足。这是一个非常合理的解决方案。
bright star. So light is in abundance. It is a very logical solution to the problem.

33
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,800
我们拥有丰富的光源，我们已经发展了许多传感器
We have an abundant source of light and we have evolved the sensor which has got many

34
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,040
优点，但主要是能够感知超出我们的距离正在发生的事情
advantages, but primarily the ability to sense what is going on at a distance beyond our

35
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:24,200
指尖。那么视觉感是如何演变的呢？那里
fingertips. So how did the sense of vision evolve? There

36
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:30,560
对此有很多猜测，但一般认为是光敏细胞
is a lot of speculation about this, but generally it is accepted that light sensitive cells

37
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,150
很久以前出现在非常原始的生命形体上，超过500万
appeared on the bodies of very primitive life forms a long time ago, more than 500 million

38
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:40,849
几年前，他们有能力感知亮度或光线。也许这就是
years ago, and they have the ability to sense brightness or light. And perhaps this was

39
00:03:40,849 --> 00:03:45,830
有用的解决方向是什么，以及哪种方式下降，也许你可以看到阴影
useful to work out which way was up and which way was down and maybe you could see the shadow

40
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:51,060
经历的事情，这是一个有用的东西。所以这些光感受器可以
of something going across and that was a useful thing to have. So these photoreceptors could

41
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,020
感觉光，它们通过某种原始神经纤维连接到某种程度
sense light and they were connected by some sort of primitive nerve fibres to some sort

42
00:03:56,020 --> 00:04:00,060
原始大脑。这显然是一个有用的想法，因为结束
of primitive brain. This was clearly a useful idea because over

43
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:06,940
光感受器被安排成曲线或三维的时间进入杯子。
time the photoreceptors were arranged into a curve, or in three dimensions, into a cup.

44
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:12,160
这使得光感受器能够响应来自特定方向的光线
And this allowed the photoreceptors to respond to rays that came from a particular direction

45
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:16,109
在太空。这比仅知道有一些亮点更有用
in space. And this was more useful than just knowing that there was something bright out

46
00:04:16,109 --> 00:04:21,549
在那里，现在我们知道了明亮事物的方向，这带来了一些优势。这个
there, now we knew the direction of the bright thing and this conferred some advantage. This

47
00:04:21,549 --> 00:04:27,100
随着时间的推移，设计得到了提升，房间里充满了水，也许是他们的
design was refined over time, the chamber became filled with water, perhaps they had

48
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:33,400
更好的光学性能，然后有一些覆盖物进化。然后是镜头
better optical properties, and then there was sort of coverings evolved. And then lenses

49
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,690
进化。直到我们今天得到类似人眼的东西，我们才有，保护
evolved. Until we get to something like the human eye today were we have, you know, protective

50
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:44,380
层，我们有镜头。我们有一个虹膜，它调节光量
layers, and we have lenses. We have an iris, which regulates the amount of light which

51
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:50,199
落在视网膜上。因此，我们可以在低光照和强光条件下良好地运行。
falls onto the retinas. So we can operate quite well in low light and bright light conditions.

52
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:54,810
这里显示的这个黄色层的感光器通过一束连接
The photoreceptors, which are this yellow layer shown here, are connected by a bunch

53
00:04:54,810 --> 00:05:01,050
神经纤维，视神经，将这些刺激带到光学或视觉部分
of nerve fibres, the optic nerve, which carry those stimuli to the optical or visual parts

54
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:05,870
大脑这实际上是位于我们脑后的大脑的一部分。
of the brain. And that is actually the part of the brain located at the back of our head.
