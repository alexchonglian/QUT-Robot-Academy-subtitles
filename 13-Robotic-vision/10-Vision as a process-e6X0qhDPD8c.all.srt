1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:08,870
我们看世界的方式实际上非常复杂。我们的眼睛不像相机那样
The way we see the world is actually quite complex. Our eyes are not like a camera that

2
00:00:08,870 --> 00:00:15,289
拍摄我们然后去处理的图像。当我们看一个场景时，我们的眼睛不断移动
takes an image that we then go and process. As we look at a scene our eye moves continuously

3
00:00:15,289 --> 00:00:21,011
在场景中的不同点，以提高其对内容的理解
to different points in the scene in order to improve its understanding of what is in

4
00:00:21,011 --> 00:00:26,130
它的前面。所以看到实际上是一个非常活跃的过程。
front of it. So seeing is actually a very active process.

5
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:30,869
因此，研究人员开发出的技术可以让我们研究人类的位置
So researchers have developed technology that allows us to study where a human being is

6
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:36,320
看着;涉及一个摄像机，它可以看到被摄体的眼睛，也许还有一个照明
looking; involves a camera which looks at the subject’s eyes, and perhaps an illumination

7
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:42,790
系统。因此，通过这种方式，我们可以持续，实时地在人类正在寻找的地方进行锻炼。
system. So with this we can work out continuously and in real time where a human being is looking.

8
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:50,899
现在这幅画被用于一项非常着名的研究，该研究于1967年进行
Now this painting was used in a very famous study that was conducted back in 1967 into

9
00:00:50,899 --> 00:00:56,640
人类主体的凝视如何取决于他们被问到的特定问题。
how a human subject’s gaze depends on the particular question that they were asked.

10
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:01,550
所以他们能做的就是拿一个主题，问他们一个问题，然后跟踪他们的位置
So what they could do is take a subject, ask them a question and then track where their

11
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:07,890
眼睛看着画里。所以这是一个例子：这是一个跟踪，一个主题
eye looked within the painting. So here is an example: here is one trace, one subject

12
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:14,859
跟踪。你可以看到他们的目光在房间里四处移动。在这三个问题中，
trace. You can see that their gaze is moving all around the room. So of these three questions,

13
00:01:14,859 --> 00:01:20,310
您认为哪个问题导致了这种特殊的凝视模式
which question do you think was asked that led to this particular gaze pattern by that

14
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,759
人类主体。我会让你暂时考虑一下。
human subject. I will let you think about that for a moment.

15
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,020
这是答案。提出的问题是：'什么是物质情况
And here is the answer. The question that was asked is: ‘What are the material circumstances

16
00:01:29,020 --> 00:01:32,539
这个家庭？'所以为了回答这个问题，人类
of the family?’. So in order to answer this question, the human

17
00:01:32,539 --> 00:01:37,649
主体已经将目光投向了特定家庭的财产。所以他们是
subject has directed their gaze towards the possessions of the particular family. So they’re

18
00:01:37,649 --> 00:01:43,020
检查家具，他们正在检查墙上的画作，等等。所以
checking out the furniture, they are checking out the paintings on the wall and so on. So

19
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:49,569
给一个主题一个特定的问题，我们的眼睛以特定的方式在场景中移动
given a specific question to a subject, our eye moves over the scene in a particular way

20
00:01:49,569 --> 00:01:53,889
以便最好地回答这个问题。这不仅仅是拍照的问题
so as to best answer the question. It’s not just a matter of taking a picture and

21
00:01:53,889 --> 00:02:00,209
处理它：我们的眼睛主动在场景中移动，以便最好地回答问题。
processing it: our eye actively moves around the scene in order to best answer the question.

22
00:02:00,209 --> 00:02:09,330
这是另一个实验。看看你是否可以找出问题。
Here is another experiment. See if you can work out which question has been asked.

23
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:15,220
我们可以看到凝视特别是检查特定人的面部区域
We can see that the gaze is checking out particularly the facial regions of the particular people

24
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:21,130
这里。所以被问到的问题是：“这幅画中的人物年龄是多少？”。
here. So the question that was asked is: ‘What are the ages of the figures in the painting?’.

25
00:02:21,130 --> 00:02:25,480
很明显，看一看人们的面孔是有用的，以便弄清楚他们的想法
So clearly it is useful to look at the faces of the people in order to work out what their

26
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:29,310
年龄是。第三，在这种特殊情况下，这是
age is. Third one, in this particular case this is

27
00:02:29,310 --> 00:02:34,430
这个主题的凝视是做什么的。我们可以看到他检查面孔，它也是
what the subject’s gaze did. We can see him checking out the faces, and it is also

28
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:42,100
在这幅画中检查每个人类主体的整个身体。问题
checking out the whole body of each of the human subjects in this painting. And the question

29
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:46,100
有人问：“这个家庭穿什么类型的衣服？”。
that was asked is: ‘What type of clothes are the family wearing?’.

30
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:50,810
因此，如果主题回答了这个特定的问题，那么他们的目光只是集中注意力
So given the subject was answering that particular question, then their gaze is focused just

31
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,830
在每个人的脸和衣服上。它不是在看家具;
on the faces and the clothes of each of the people. It is not looking at the furniture;

32
00:02:54,830 --> 00:02:57,790
它不是在看画作;它看不到窗外。
it is not looking at the paintings; it’s not looking out the window.

33
00:02:57,790 --> 00:03:04,380
重要的是要了解视觉是一个非常活跃的过程。现在它被驱动了
It is important to understand that seeing is a very active process. Now it is driven

34
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:10,180
也许是人体内一些运动最快的肌肉。所以人眼能够
by perhaps some of the fastest moving muscles in the human body. So the human eye is able

35
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:14,710
以每秒高达六百度的速度旋转，并具有惊人的加速度，
to rotate at up to six hundred degrees per second, and has a phenomenal acceleration,

36
00:03:14,710 --> 00:03:21,630
像每秒35000º的平方，所以惊人的肌肉能够指向眼睛
something like 35000º per second squared, so amazing muscles are able to point the eye

37
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:27,500
很快在眼睛视野范围内的任何地方。
very quickly anywhere within the field of view of the eyes.

38
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:33,340
因此，我非常喜欢这位非常有名的早期视觉研究员大卫
So this lovely quote that I like very much by a very famous early vision researcher David

39
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:38,790
马尔。他说视觉是“从图像中发现存在的东西的过程
Marr. And he says vision is ‘the process of discovering from images what is present

40
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:44,660
在世界和它的所在地。因此，愿景是一个过程。我认为这是非常重要的
in the world and where it is’. So vision is a process. I think that is a very important

41
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:48,819
当我们开始思考机器人可能会看到的时候，我们会把这个消息带走。
message to take away when we start to think about how robots might see.
