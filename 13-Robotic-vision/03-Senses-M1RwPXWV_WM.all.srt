00:00:03,399 --> 00:00:08,090
当我还是一个在学校的年轻人时，他们告诉我们，我们有五种感官，但我会争辩
When I was a young person at school they taught us that we had five senses, but I would argue

2
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:13,969
今天他们忽略了一个非常重要的第六感，即平衡感。
today that they have overlooked a very important sixth sense, which is the sense of balance.

3
00:00:13,969 --> 00:00:19,230
对于像人类这样的直立行走动物来说，平衡感是绝对必要的，
The sense of balance is absolutely essential to upright walking animals like human beings,

4
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:26,070
并且我们使用位于我们内耳，前庭的一些感官来达到平衡
and we achieve balance using some senses that are located in our inner ear, in the vestibular

5
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:31,529
设备，我们有相当于提供的加速度计和陀螺仪
apparatus where we have the equivalent of accelerometers and gyroscopes that provide

6
00:00:31,529 --> 00:00:38,749
让我们保持正直的信息。平衡绝对是至关重要的，也是人类的第六感。
the information to keep us upright. Balance is absolutely critical and the human being’s sixth sense.

7
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:42,940
其他动物已经进化出不同的感知
Other animals have evolved different sensing

8
00:00:42,950 --> 00:00:49,230
人类拥有的方式。例如，像蝙蝠这样的小型飞行动物就有这种感觉
modalities to those the humans have. For instance, small flying animals like bats have the sense

9
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:54,320
回声位置;它们发出声能脉冲并听取反射
of echo location; they send out pulses of acoustic energy and listen for the reflections

10
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:58,990
他们在晚上以相当高的速度飞行时会使用它来寻找障碍物
and they use this when they are flying at quite high speed at night to find obstacles

11
00:00:58,990 --> 00:01:03,710
他们想要避免并找到他们想吃的昆虫。
that they would want to avoid and to find insects that they would wish to eat.

12
00:01:03,710 --> 00:01:08,300
鲨鱼在身体周围创造一个电场，然后它们可以感知干扰
Sharks create an electric field around their body and then they can sense disturbances

13
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:13,960
在他们的电场，这是由鱼靠近游泳引起的
in their electric field, which are caused by fish swimming in close proximity to the

14
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:19,520
鲨鱼的身体，这对他们来说非常有用，以便检测食物的来源。
shark’s body, and this is really useful for them in order to detect sources of food.

15
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,120
最后，鸽子具有天生的磁性感。他们有磁感
Finally, pigeons have got an innate sense of magnetism. They have magnetic senses in

16
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:29,780
他们的头让他们知道北方在哪里，这绝对是必不可少的
their heads that allow them to tell where north is and this is absolutely essential

17
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,159
对于他们长途飞行，一个必不可少的导航援助。
for them in their flying long distances, an essential navigational aid.

18
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:39,370
现在对我们来说，几乎不可能想象出“北方”的感觉，
Now for us, it’s almost impossible to imagine what a sense of ‘northness’ feels like,

19
00:01:39,370 --> 00:01:44,700
但是鸽子有这种感觉，因此动物有许多很多不同的感官
but pigeons have that sense, so there are many, many, different senses that animals

20
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,030
随着时间的推移已经发展，以帮助他们履行生活的基本功能。
have evolved over time to help them perform the essential functions of life.
