1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:07,890
当我们开始谈论机器人和传感器的需求时，很多人的问题
When we start talking about robots and the need for sensors, the question that many people

2
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:12,699
问：'为什么我们不使用GPS，当然这已经足够了？'。GPS无处不在-它是
ask is: ‘Why don’t we just use GPS, surely that’s enough?’. GPS is everywhere—it’s

3
00:00:12,699 --> 00:00:17,270
在我们的手机中，它在我们的汽车中...它告诉我们我们在哪里。让我们谈一点
in our phones, it’s in our cars … it tells us where we are. So let’s talk a little

4
00:00:17,270 --> 00:00:21,660
关于GPS。想象一下，我们在地面上有一个机器人
bit about GPS. Imagine we have a robot on the ground and

5
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:26,670
它的头部有一个GPS接收器。在天空中有许多低卫星
it’s got a GPS receiver in its head. In the sky are a number of satellites in low

6
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:32,119
地球轨道，他们都发送无线电波，机器人的GPS接收器
earth orbit, and they are all sending radio waves which the GPS receiver in the robot’s

7
00:00:32,119 --> 00:00:35,860
头可以拿起来。利用无线电波所需的时间
head can pick up. Using the time that it takes the radio wave

8
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:42,080
从每颗卫星到机器人，我们可以计算出每颗卫星到机器人的距离。
to travel from each satellite to the robot we can work out the distance from each satellite to the robot.

9
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:46,140
如果我们知道足够的距离-我们知道卫星在太空中的位置-
If we know enough of these distances—we know where the satellites are in space—

10
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:48,820
那么我们就可以找出机器人的位置。
then we can work out where the robot is.

11
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:54,950
这是GPS的基本原理。现在这些无线电波的频率非常高;
That’s the fundamental principle of GPS. Now these radio waves are at a very high frequency;

12
00:00:54,950 --> 00:00:59,820
它们大约在1.5千兆赫兹左右，这很重要，我们将讨论为什么会这样
they are around about 1.5 gigahertz, and that’s significant and we’ll talk about why that’s

13
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:03,629
重要的是。想象一下，现在我们正在向上看
significant shortly. Imagine now we’re looking upwards from the

14
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:06,850
机器人。我们仰望天空，我们可以拥有许多卫星
robot. We’re looking up to the sky, and there are a number of satellites that we can

15
00:01:06,850 --> 00:01:13,039
看到。事实上，我们只需要四颗卫星来计算我们在这个星球上的位置。那是
see. We only need four satellites in fact, to work out where we are on the planet. That’s

16
00:01:13,039 --> 00:01:16,450
获得所谓“修复”的最低要求。
the minimum requirement in order to get what’s called a ‘fix’.

17
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:21,130
现在想象一下我们的机器人在城市环境中。想象一下，我们正在一条街上
Now imagine that our robot is in an urban environment. Imagine we’re on a street in

18
00:01:21,130 --> 00:01:26,649
曼哈顿或类似的东西。所以现在发生的是天空的某些部分
Manhattan or something like that. So what happens now is that some part of the sky is

19
00:01:26,649 --> 00:01:32,170
模糊。我们看不到所有的卫星。现在我们只能看到两颗卫星
obscured. We can’t see all of the satellites. Now we can only see two satellites and that’s

20
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:38,319
不足以获得修复。这是一种非常普遍的现象，这就是我们遇到问题的原因
not enough to obtain a fix. This is a very common phenomenon, that’s why we have problems

21
00:01:38,319 --> 00:01:43,729
在城市环境中使用GPS。但它也发生在其他环境中。它可以发生
with GPS in urban environments. But it occurs in other environments as well. It can occur

22
00:01:43,729 --> 00:01:49,200
也许是在一个非常非常深的采矿坑里，坑的墙壁掩盖了一个重要的地方
perhaps in a very, very deep mining pit where the walls of the pit obscure a significant

23
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,299
天空的一部分。现在想象我们有我们的机器人而且它是
fraction of the sky. Now imagine that we have our robot and it’s

24
00:01:53,299 --> 00:01:58,630
在一些大型工业园区。有大型的墙壁和烟囱和结构
at some big industrial complex. There are large walls and chimneys and structures made

25
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,679
没有金属。现在在这种情况下发生的是来自卫星的信号可能
out of metal. Now what happens in this case is that the signals from the satellite may

26
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:08,340
不能直接前往机器人。它们可能会从这些金属中弹出一些
not travel in a direct line to the robot. They may bounce off some of these metallic

27
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:13,710
结构在击中机器人之前。问题在于信号有
structures before they hit the robot. The problem with this is that the signals have

28
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:18,480
行进的距离比机器人和卫星之间的实际距离长。
travelled a longer distance than the actual distance between the robot and the satellite.

29
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:23,210
路径长度通过所谓的“多路径反射”而增加。所以
The path length has increased through what’s called ‘multi-pathed reflection’. So the

30
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:28,990
机器人内部的GPS接收器不知道这一点，所以它会出现错误
GPS receiver within the robot doesn’t know this, so it will come up with an erroneous

31
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:33,510
估计机器人的位置。这也是一个非常普遍的问题
estimate of where the robot is located. This is, again, quite a common problem with

32
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:40,440
GPS旁边是反映无线电波的大型结构。GPS估计机器人位置
GPS next to a big structure that reflects radio waves. The GPS estimated robot position

33
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,540
可能会出现严重错误。现在让我们考虑另一种情况。考虑
can be significantly in error. Now let’s consider another scenario. Consider

34
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,850
我们的机器人在地下，也许做一些采矿工作，这是一个非常重要的领域
that our robot is underground, perhaps doing some mining work, a really important domain

35
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:55,850
对于机器人。现在我们在这里遇到的问题是来自卫星的无线电波
for robots. Now the problem that we have here is that the radio waves from the satellite

36
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,710
无法穿透地球。
cannot penetrate the earth.

37
00:02:58,710 --> 00:03:02,840
我们可能想要使用机器人的另一个应用是水下。我们又一次
Another application where we might want to use robots is underwater. And again we have

38
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:09,190
与我们在地下案件中遇到的问题相同。1.5千兆赫的无线电波不能
the same problem as we have in the underground case. The radio waves at 1.5 gigahertz cannot

39
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:14,510
深入水中。它们可能会穿透几毫米。所以这是一个机器人
penetrate very far into water. They perhaps penetrate a few millimetres. So a robot that’s

40
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:18,710
在任何深度都可以完全不使用GPS信息。
at any depth can make absolutely no use of GPS information.

41
00:03:18,710 --> 00:03:25,180
现在让我们考虑一下我们在户外的情况，但机器人上方有树木。问题
Now let’s consider a situation we’re outdoors but there are trees above the robot. The problem

42
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:30,390
我们这里实际上与最后一个非常相似。叶子里有很多水
we have here is actually very similar to the last one. There is a lot of water in the leaves

43
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:34,170
树木，特别是在下雨之后，那里有很多水
of the trees, and particularly after it has been raining then there’s a lot of the water

44
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:40,620
在叶子的表面上。而这水从中吸收了1.5千兆赫的无线电波
on the surface of the leaves. And this water absorbs the 1.5 gigahertz radio waves from

45
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,620
卫星，它们不会穿透。所以用重型树冠GPS无线电波
the satellite, and they won’t penetrate. So with heavy tree canopy GPS radio waves

46
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,020
被吸收，我们不会获得足够的信息让机器人获得
are absorbed, and we’re not going to get enough information for the robot to obtain

47
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:53,860
修复。但是还有另一个也许是更深层次的原因
a fix. But there’s another and perhaps deeper reason

48
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:59,530
为什么GPS不是所有机器人问题的解决方案。考虑这种典型案例
why GPS is not the solution to all robotic problems. Consider this kind of typical case

49
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:02,300
我有一个机器人，它想要拿起一个物体。
where I’ve got a robot and it wants to pick up an object.

50
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:07,680
所以这个机器人想拿起那个香蕉。现在我可以为机器人添加GPS接收器，
So this robot wants to pick up that banana. Now I can add a GPS receiver to the robot,

51
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,819
所以机器人现在知道它在世界上的位置。但它并没有真正帮助，因为
so the robot now knows where it is in the world. But it doesn’t really help, because

52
00:04:11,819 --> 00:04:16,560
它真的不知道香蕉在哪里。所以我可以在香蕉上添加GPS接收器，
it doesn’t really know where the banana is. So I can add a GPS receiver to the banana,

53
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,349
现在香蕉知道它在哪里;机器人知道它在哪里。但它仍然没有
and now the banana knows where it is; the robot knows where it is. But it still hasn’t

54
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:25,930
帮助这个机器人知道香蕉在哪里可以移动的问题
helped with this problem of this robot knowing where the banana is so that it can move and

55
00:04:25,930 --> 00:04:31,099
抓住它。因此，为了获得有关香蕉位置的信息，我可以
grasp it. So in order to get information about the banana’s position to the robot I could

56
00:04:31,099 --> 00:04:37,110
在香蕉上为这个GPS接收器添加一个无线电发射器，我可以添加一个接收器
add a radio transmitter to this GPS receiver on the banana, and I could add a receiver

57
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:42,770
到了机器人。所以现在机器人知道香蕉在哪里，它的坐标是
to the robot. So now the robot knows where the banana is, it has the coordinates of the

58
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:48,499
香蕉;它知道它在哪里，并且拥有这两条信息，机器人就可以了
banana; it knows where it is, and having those two pieces of information, the robot can then

59
00:04:48,499 --> 00:04:55,849
计划一条路，以便从这里到达那里。现在虽然这可能有用，但基本
plan a path in order to get from here to there. Now while this might work, the fundamental

60
00:04:55,849 --> 00:05:00,879
问题是机器人想要拾取，使用和操纵的每个对象
problem is that every object that the robot would want to pick up, work with and manipulate

61
00:05:00,879 --> 00:05:06,430
需要配备这种仪器，显然这不是我们解决这个问题的方法
needs to be fitted with this kind of instrumentation, and clearly this is not the way we solve this

62
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:11,110
问题。如果我想拿起香蕉，我只需伸手去拿，我用眼睛锻炼身体
problem. If I want to pick up the banana I simply reach out, I use my eyes to work out

63
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:13,699
在哪里，并引导我的手，以便捡起它。
where it is and guide my hand in order to pick it up.
