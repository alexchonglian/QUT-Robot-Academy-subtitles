00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:06,370
视觉感一直让人着迷。
The sense of vision has long fascinated human kind.

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:12,230
在希腊人的时代，他们认为视觉有点类似于感觉
In the time of the Greeks, they believed that vision was somewhat analogous to the sense

3
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:16,890
触摸发生的事情是当你睁开眼睛然后看着那里的物体时
of touch. And what happened is when you open your eyes and you looked at an object there

4
00:00:16,890 --> 00:00:24,140
是一些视觉火焰，一些视觉通量离开你的眼睛，走出去触摸对象
was some visual fire, some visual flux left your eye, went out and touched the object

5
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:30,769
而视觉感觉实际上是这种散发的通量和物体之间的相互作用
and the sense of vision was in fact the interaction between this emanating flux and the object

6
00:00:30,769 --> 00:00:34,600
本身。这就像是一种长距离的触觉。
itself. It was like a long distance sense of touch.

7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:42,059
随着时间的推移，对视觉工作方式的现代解释得到了发展，当然也是如此
Over time the modern interpretation of the way vision works was developed, and certainly

8
00:00:42,059 --> 00:00:46,859
据我所知，到了中世纪，人们已经很清楚了。我们今天的理解方式
by the Middle Ages I think, it was quite well understood. And the way we understand today

9
00:00:46,859 --> 00:00:52,840
是一个场景被光源照亮，在这种情况下是太阳。光线
is that a scene is illuminated by a light source, in this case the sun. Rays of light

10
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:57,420
落在物体上，并反映到各种不同的方向，有的
fall down onto objects and is reflected into all sorts of different directions, and some

11
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:03,309
这些光线被反射到我们的眼睛中，在那里它们聚焦在光感受器上
of those light rays are reflected into our eye, where they are focused onto photoreceptors

12
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:10,489
并导致对大脑的一些刺激，我们将其解释为视觉感知。
and lead to some stimulation to the brain, which we interpret as visual perception.
