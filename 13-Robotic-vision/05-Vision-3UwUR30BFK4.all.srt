1
00:00:03,709 --> 00:00:08,559
让我们继续讨论视觉感受。其中一件事
Let’s continue our discussion about the sense of vision. One of the things that makes

2
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:14,450
视觉这样一个强大的传感器是它是一个远程传感器。它让我们感受到
vision such a powerful sensor is that it is a long-range sensor. It allows us to sense

3
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:20,769
超越我们指尖的世界。我们的指尖，我们的手臂只允许我们到达和探索
the world beyond our fingertips. Our fingertips, our arms only allow us to reach and explore

4
00:00:20,769 --> 00:00:25,999
我们周围空间的一小部分。但有时候最重要的
a relatively small part of the space that is around us. But sometimes the most important

5
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:30,479
我们需要知道的事情远远超出我们指尖的范围;通过
things that we need to know about are far beyond the reach of our fingertips; by the

6
00:00:30,479 --> 00:00:36,870
时间紧密的事情可能已经太晚了，所以视觉让我们看到了几十个
time things are that close it is perhaps too late, so vision allows us to see for tens

7
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:42,920
米，几百米，一个非常大的距离，这是一个非常大的美德
of meters, hundreds of meters, a very great distance and that is a really big virtue of

8
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:46,910
视觉感。感觉的另一个重要特征
the sense of vision. Another important characteristic of a sense

9
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:52,149
愿景是它提供了非常丰富的信息。我们知道一些事情
of vision is that it provides a very rich amount of information. We know something about

10
00:00:52,149 --> 00:00:56,699
对象的形状，我们知道对象的颜色和形状
the shape of the object, we know something about the colour of the object, and that shape

11
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:02,679
除了纹理之外，还有颜色允许我们对对象进行分类以确定哪种类型
and colour in addition to texture allows us to classify the object to work out what sort

12
00:01:02,679 --> 00:01:06,360
事情就是这样。这是我们感兴趣的事情吗？这是我们想要的
of thing it is. Is it a thing that we are interested in? Is it something we want to

13
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:11,670
逃避？或者我们想走向？它是什么类型的对象，这绝对是
run away from? Or we want to move towards? What sort of object it is, and that is absolutely

14
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:16,450
对于人们和机器人的许多，许多应用来说都是至关重要的。
critical for many, many applications for people and also for robots.

15
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:21,950
视觉的另一个巨大优势是它为我们提供了有关运动的信息，它告诉我们
Another great advantage of vision is it gives us information about motion and it tells us

16
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,930
关于事物如何在我们周围移动，所以我们可以看到一个物体，我们可以看到它在移动。
about how things are moving around us, so we can see an object and we can see it moving.

17
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:31,860
它离我们越来越近了，它会走得更远吗？但它也提供了大量信息
Is it getting closer to us, is it going further away? But it also provides a lot of information

18
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:37,439
关于我们如何移动，所以当我们走遍世界时，其他事情似乎已经过去了
about how we are moving, so as we walk through the world other things appear to move past

19
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:43,640
我们由于我们自己的议案。这么多动物使用视觉和视觉的事实
us due to our own motion. The fact that so many animals use vision and

20
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:50,500
在地球上，视觉感已经多次独立演变，
that the sense of vision has evolved independently multiple times here on planet earth argue,

21
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:58,420
我认为，对于视觉的有效性。几乎所有动物我们都使用
I think, for the effectiveness of the sense of vision. For almost all animals we use the

22
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:04,109
生命中真正重要的事物的视觉感。我们用它来帮助我们找到食物，我们
sense of vision for the really important things in life. We use it to help us find food, we

23
00:02:04,109 --> 00:02:10,700
用它来避免被其他动物吃掉，我们用它来寻找我们的伴侣。所以所有的
use it to avoid being eaten by other animals and we use it to find our mates. So all the

24
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:16,410
重要的生命功能是通过视觉来调节的。
important life functions are mediated through the sense of vision.

25
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:21,110
看看由各种不同的动物做的这些任务。考虑
Have a look at these tasks being preformed by a variety of different animals. Consider

26
00:02:21,110 --> 00:02:26,390
蜜蜂和蜜蜂是一种小动物，脑部非常小，但它有两只眼睛。
the bee, and a bee is a small animal, with a very small brain, but it has got two eyes.

27
00:02:26,390 --> 00:02:31,690
相当复杂的眼睛，与我们的眼睛非常不同，但它可以表现得相当复杂
Quite complex eyes, very different sorts of eyes to ours, but it can perform quite complicated

28
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:37,280
功能。它可以飞行很长的距离，以便找到一些其他的花
functions. It can fly for a long distance in order to locate some flowers that other

29
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:42,000
蜜蜂已经告知了它。它可以落在移动的花朵上，也可以分辨出它
bees have informed it about. It can land on a moving flower or it can tell the difference

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:49,290
在一朵花和一片叶子之间。因此非常复杂的功能对蜜蜂的生命至关重要
between a flower and a leaf. So quite complex functions critical to the life of the bee

31
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:54,280
它的集落基本上是用视觉进行的。
and its colony are performed essentially using vision.

32
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:58,140
在中间，我们有人接球。他们用眼睛去抓住
In the middle, we have somebody catching a ball. They are using their eyes to catch the

33
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,260
球。他们没有使用GPS或任何其他类型的技术传感器。这个人
ball. They are not using GPS or any other kind of technological sensor. This person

34
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:07,560
他们把目光投向球，这是一个非常着名的表达方式。看着
has got their eyes on the ball and that is a very well-known expression. Watching the

35
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:11,200
球在空中移动时，他们有一些关于如何的心理模型
ball as it moves through the air and they have got some sort of mental model about how

36
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,040
球在空中移动。然后，他们正在使用它来计划他们的手应该如何
balls move through the air. They are using that, then, to plan how their hands should

37
00:03:16,040 --> 00:03:22,530
移动是为了成功掌握球权。所以我们用眼睛去感知
move in order to achieve a successful grasp of the ball. So we are using our eyes to sense

38
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:27,980
球。我们正在制定计划，然后我们正在采取行动，我们正在动手以拦截它。
the ball. We are making a plan and then we are acting, we are moving our hands in order to intercept it.

39
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:33,370
最后一个例子是驾驶，我们用眼睛观察道路，人们
And the last example is driving, where we are using our eyes to observe the road, people

40
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:38,060
和正在路上行驶的汽车。我们已经知道了我们想要去的地方。
and cars that are moving on the road. We’ve got an idea of where it is we want to go.

41
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:43,030
因此，我们正在使用视觉信息，并考虑到目标。我们正在制定计划
So we are using the visual information with a goal in mind. We are making a plan about

42
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:47,710
如何沿着这条路走下去，然后我们通过转动
how to navigate down this particular bit of road and then we are acting by turning the

43
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:51,030
方向盘，踩刹车踏板或加速器。
steering wheel, pushing the brake pedal or the accelerator.
