1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:07,140
我们已经涵盖了很多主题。我们已经谈到了视觉的演变。我们
We have covered a lot of topics. We have talked about how the sense of vision evolved. We

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:12,220
谈到了人类视觉的细节。我们看了一些动物的种类
have talked about the details of human vision. We have looked at some of the variety of animal

3
00:00:12,220 --> 00:00:18,019
视力。我们已经讨论过视觉是一个眼睛积极引导的过程
vision. We have talked about how vision is a process where the eye is actively steered

4
00:00:18,019 --> 00:00:22,880
在场景周围，以最大限度地了解特定场景。
around the scene in order to maximise our understanding of that particular scene.

5
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:28,999
因此，现在讨论机器人和视觉，并了解机器人如何使用是恰当的
So now it is appropriate to talk about robots and vision, and look at how robots have used

6
00:00:28,999 --> 00:00:34,260
为了能够以与人类相似的方式执行任务的视觉感
the sense of vision in order to be able to perform tasks, in a similar way to which humans

7
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,150
和动物使用视觉来执行任务。左边的机器人是一个非常有名的机器人
and animals use vision to perform tasks. The robot on the left is a very famous robot

8
00:00:40,150 --> 00:00:45,760
叫沙基。20世纪60年代在SRIInternational开发。它有一台电视摄像机
called Shakey. Developed at SRI International in the 1960s. And it has a television camera

9
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:51,640
在顶部，它用于导航。右边的机器人就是我建造的机器人
on the top, which it uses for navigation. The robot on the right is one that I built

10
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:56,880
在21世纪初，它已经拥有相当多的摄像头，他们是一个
in the early 2000s, and it has got quite a number of cameras on board, and they are a

11
00:00:56,880 --> 00:01:01,660
看看有点有趣。在前面是一个立体相机对，它是一个
little bit interesting to look at. In the front is a stereo camera pair and it is a

12
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:06,659
有点像我们自己的两只眼睛。它允许机器人确定三维结构
bit like our own two eyes. It allows the robot to determine three dimensional structure of

13
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:12,640
在它面前的世界。在顶部，它有一个非常闪亮的镜像对象，这是一部分
the world in front of it. On the top, it has a very shiny mirror object and that is part

14
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,080
我们称之为全景相机组件。有一个摄像头抬头看着那面镜子
of what we call a panoramic camera assembly. There is a camera looking up at that mirror

15
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,490
并且允许机器人看到360度-它可以看到前进，后退和侧向。
and that allows the robot to see 360 degrees—it can see forwards, backwards and side ways.

16
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:27,890
它有时被称为全向摄像机或全景摄像机。
It’s sometimes called an omni-cam or a panoramic camera.

17
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:34,280
这个机器人的最后一个摄像头是侧面的广角摄像头。它有一个鱼眼镜头，
The last camera on this robot is a wide-angle camera on the side. It has a fish eye lens,

18
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:39,030
所以它几乎有一个半球形的视野。这可以看看发生了什么
so it almost has a hemispherical field of view. And that can look at what is happening

19
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:45,650
到机器人的一侧。目前的火星探测器，好奇号探测器，
to the side of the robot. The current Mars Rover, the Curiosity Rover,

20
00:01:45,650 --> 00:01:52,220
它拥有大量的摄像头，用于各种功能。
has got a large number of cameras on board that it uses for a variety of functions.

21
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:57,000
现在看教学机器的业务是计算机视觉领域，那
Now the business of teaching machines to see is the field of computer vision, and that

22
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:03,080
是一项自20世纪60年代以来一直在进行的活动。一些重要的早期工作
is an activity that has been going on since perhaps the 1960s. Some important early work

23
00:02:03,080 --> 00:02:08,239
由麻省理工学院的拉里·罗伯茨（LarryRoberts）作为博士项目的一部分进行。拉里接着说
was carried out by Larry Roberts at MIT as part of his PhD project. Larry went on to

24
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,410
做其他非常重要的事情，并在创建互联网方面发挥了重要作用。所以
do other very important things and was very instrumental in creating the internet. So

25
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:17,110
在他的论文作品中，他正在做的是拍摄一个物体的照片，这是非常的
in his thesis work what he was doing was taking a picture of an object, and this is a very

26
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:23,300
简单的木块对象，用电视摄像机拍照，并试图锻炼
simple wooden block object, took a picture with a TV camera and was trying to work out

27
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,310
它的形状是什么。所以他经历了许多视觉处理步骤，这些都是
what shape it was. So he went through a number of vision processing steps and these are the

28
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:31,060
我们将在以下讲座中介绍的各种事情。
sorts of things we will cover in following lectures.

29
00:02:31,060 --> 00:02:37,959
最初的步骤之一是找到这个物体的边缘，一旦找到了边缘
One of the first steps was to find the edges of this object and once he had found the edges

30
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:42,980
他会尝试将线段与这些边缘相匹配，一旦他知道这些线条
of the object he would try to fit line segments to those edges and once he knew those line

31
00:02:42,980 --> 00:02:47,690
他知道图像的形成方式。然后他可以说些什么
segments, he knew something about the way images are formed. He could then say something

32
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:53,050
关于这个特定物体的三维形状。所以我们在这里有
about the three dimensional shape of this particular object. So what we have here is

33
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:58,290
一个可以拍摄图像并对其进行处理并提出三维模型的系统
a system that can take an image and process it and come up with a three dimensional model

34
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:04,330
那种形状。所以它是一种非常简单的物体识别形式。电脑需要
of that shape. So it is a very simple form of object recognition. The computers take

35
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:09,800
一个图像，并讨论它正在看什么样的对象。那是
an image and made a discussion about what sort of object that it was looking at. That’s

36
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:14,810
足够的信息，然后机器人进行移动，去挑选该对象和
sufficient information then for a robot to make a move, go and pick that object up and

37
00:03:14,810 --> 00:03:20,319
或许以某种方式操纵它。那么为什么视觉是机器人的良好传感器呢？
perhaps manipulate it in some way. So why is vision a good sensor for a robot

38
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,879
具有？我认为视力是重要且非常实用的原因有几个
to have? There are a few reasons why I believe vision is an important and very practical

39
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:29,489
用于机器人的传感器。首先，相机本身现在非常
sensor for a robot. Firstly, the cameras themselves are now very

40
00:03:29,489 --> 00:03:34,099
价格便宜，其原因在于摄像机内置于一切;内置于细胞中
cheap and the reason for this is because cameras are built into everything; built into cell

41
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:40,519
手机，内置于笔记本电脑等。所以实际传感器相当于视网膜
phones, built into laptops, and so on. So the actual sensor the equivalent of a retina

42
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:45,150
现在是一种可能花费不到1美元的设备。镜头较小，镜头较小
is now a device that perhaps costs less then a dollar. Lenses are smaller, cameras are

43
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:47,709
小而便宜。另一个非常重要的原因
small and cheap. The other reason that is really important

44
00:03:47,709 --> 00:03:52,580
是计算现在真的很便宜;我们有非常强大的计算机芯片和很多
is that computation is now really cheap; we have very powerful computer chips and lots

45
00:03:52,580 --> 00:03:57,440
和大量的内存，所以这使我们能够运行算法来处理数据
and lots of memory, and so this enables us to run algorithms to process the data that

46
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:02,720
来自传感器芯片。所以这种组合非常有效，高
comes out of the sensor chip. So this combination of very effective, high

47
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:09,290
分辨率，颜色，便宜的传感器，丰富的计算是我们的基础
resolution, colour, cheap sensors, with abundant computation are the foundations on which we

48
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:13,569
可以建立机器人视觉系统。这是Ray的一张非常有趣的图表
can build robot vision systems. Here is a really interesting graph from Ray

49
00:04:13,569 --> 00:04:20,880
Kurzweil，他谈了很多关于计算能力随时间变化的方式，以及
Kurzweil, and he talks a lot about the way computation power has changed over time, and

50
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:27,470
这是一个对数垂直标度，他正在绘制一些代表的数据点
this is a logarithmic vertical scale and he’s plotting a number of data points that represent

51
00:04:27,470 --> 00:04:33,479
随着时间的推移，你每秒可以购买一千美元的计算量。和
a number of calculations per second you can buy for a thousand dollars over time. And

52
00:04:33,479 --> 00:04:39,290
我们可以看到这是一个对数垂直尺度的指数图。它是什么呢
we can see that this is an exponential plot on a logarithmic vertical scale. So what it

53
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:44,639
显示的是计算确实在增加，随着时间的推移越来越快。这是
is showing is computation is really increasing, increasingly rapidly with time. And this is

54
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,290
从根本上说，RayKurzweil的论文。所以，如果我们将此推断到未来，
fundamentally Ray Kurzweil's thesis. So if we extrapolate this into the future,

55
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:57,360
我们可以看到我们在这里，我们有一个有效的计算能力
we can see that we are about here, and we have computational power of effectively one

56
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,639
小鼠脑。到20世纪20年代初，我们应该拥有一千个
mouse brain. By the early 2020s we should have, for a thousand

57
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:09,759
美元，人类大脑的计算能力。到2050年，当你们许多人将会
dollars, the computational power of a human brain. And by 2050 when many of you will be

58
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,810
活着，也许是在你工作生涯的最后，你会花一千美元
alive, perhaps at the ends of your working careers, for a thousand dollars you will be

59
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:20,710
能够购买相当于地球上所有人类大脑的足够计算能力。
able to buy enough computing power to the equivalent of all human brains on the planet.

60
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:26,430
这是一个非常惊人的预测，非常非常非常激动人心的时刻。
That is a pretty amazing prediction and so clearly very, very exciting times ahead.

61
00:05:26,430 --> 00:05:31,470
那么机器人专家对传感器视觉做了哪些实际的事情呢？
So what practical things have roboticists been doing with sensor vision?

62
00:05:31,470 --> 00:05:37,370
我们最近听到很多关于自动驾驶汽车，谷歌汽车等等，但实际情况
We hear a lot in recent times about self-driving cars, Google cars and so on, but the actual

63
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:43,070
自动驾驶汽车的历史可以追溯到很久以前。有一些非常重要的研究
history of self-driving cars goes back a long way. There was some very significant research

64
00:05:43,070 --> 00:05:49,040
20世纪80年代欧洲的计划叫做普罗米修斯，并且做了很多非常基础的工作
program in Europe in the 1980s called Prometheus, and a lot of very fundamental work was done

65
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:56,320
一位叫ErnstDickmanns的科学家。他自动化这辆面包车。它有很多相机
by a scientist called Ernst Dickmanns. He automated this van. It had a number of cameras

66
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:01,530
在前面向外看，它能够高速驾驶高速公路。
in the front looking outwards, and it was able to drive along autobahns at high speed.

67
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:06,430
这辆特定的货车和一些货车取得了许多重要的里程碑式的成就
A number of significant landmark achievements were made by this particular van and some

68
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:11,740
它的直系后代。另一项具有里程碑意义的成
of it immediate descendants. Another landmark achievement was from some

69
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:17,180
来自卡内基梅隆大学的研究人员，他们主要使用传感器自动化汽车
researchers from Carnegie Mellon University, who automated a car primarily using the sensor

70
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:22,740
愿景，并将其驱逐到美国各地。旅程花了几天，大约四千公里，
vision, and drove it across America. The journey took a few days, around four thousand kilometres,

71
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:29,600
并且人为干预的人数相对较少。这个视频显示了一个人形机器人接球。
and there were relatively few human interventions. This video shows a humanoid robot catching a ball.

72
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:33,360
在这里，我们再次以慢动作看到它。
Here we see it again in slow motion.

73
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,540
现在机器人头部有一对摄像头，
Now the robot has a pair of cameras in its head,

74
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:43,740
这允许它估计到球的距离;使用该信息进行建模
which allows it to estimate the distance to the ball; uses that information to model

75
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,900
球如何在空间中移动以规划手臂应该采取的动作
how a ball moves through space in order to plan the motion that the arm should take to

76
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:53,580
拦截球。因此，机器人的头部有许多传感器：一对相机
intercept the ball. So the robot’s head has a number of sensors: pair of cameras as

77
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:58,370
我提到过，但也有一些倾斜传感器，所以它可以解决头部指向的位置
I mentioned, but also some tilt sensors, so it can work out where the head is pointing

78
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:04,470
在太空。现在你可以看到左眼和右眼看到的球的位置
in space. Now you can see the positions of the ball as seen by its left and right eye

79
00:07:04,470 --> 00:07:10,389
作为时间的函数，在这里你可以看到机器人手移动的动画
as a function of time, and here you can see an animation of the robot’s hand moving

80
00:07:10,389 --> 00:07:16,660
拦截球的路径。这是我们实际看的飞行机器人
to intercept the path of the ball. Here is a flying robot which we actually looked

81
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:22,310
在机器人技术课程中，你们中的一些人在关闭机器人视频中近距离观看
at up close in the Out and About with Robots video, in the Robotics course some of you

82
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:27,380
可能早些时候见过。这个机器人再次配备了立体声相机。再说一遍
might have seen earlier. This robot is equipped with a stereo pair of cameras again. So again

83
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:33,030
就像我们自己的两只眼睛一样，这使机器人能够通过工作来感知它前面的障碍物
like our own two eyes, this enables the robot to sense an obstacle in front of it, by working

84
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:37,620
使用两个信息从前面的世界的三维结构
out the three dimensional structure of the world in front using information from two

85
00:07:37,620 --> 00:07:41,060
相机和船上的大量处理。
cameras and a fair amount of processing on board.

86
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:49,099
我自己和CSIRO的一些同事以及这个水下机器人开发的另一个机器人
Another robot developed by myself and some colleagues at CSIRO, and this underwater robot

87
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:53,599
还有一对立体声相机。它有两个向下看的摄像头
has also got a stereo pair of cameras. It has got two cameras that look downwards and

88
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,889
两个向前看的相机。向下看的摄像机正在估算距离
two cameras which look frontwards. The downward looking cameras are estimating the distance

89
00:07:58,889 --> 00:08:03,370
来自机器人的海底，这个机器人正试图保持恒定的高度
of the seabed from the robot, and this robot is trying to maintain a constant altitude

90
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:07,810
在海床上面。它使用来自的三维信息来做到这一点
above the sea bed. And it does that using the three dimensional information from the

91
00:08:07,810 --> 00:08:13,470
向下看的立体相机。前视立体摄像机用于探测障碍物。
downward looking stereo cameras. The frontward looking stereo cameras are used to detect obstacles.

92
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:18,460
在这里，我们看到了世界的样子
Here we see what the world looks like through

93
00:08:18,470 --> 00:08:24,380
移动机器人的眼睛。这个特殊的机器人有一个允许的立体相机对
the eyes of a mobile robot. This particular robot has got a stereo camera pair which allows

94
00:08:24,380 --> 00:08:30,009
它创造了一个通过它移动的世界的三维模型。和
it to create a three dimensional model of the world through which it is moving. And

95
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:34,500
这对于确定它可以驱动的平面是非常有用的
that is really useful in order to determine what is a flat surface that it could drive

96
00:08:34,500 --> 00:08:40,560
过去，什么是墙，或人，或其他一些障碍。
over, and what is a wall, or human being, or some other kind of obstacle.

97
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:47,340
在这里，我们有一些不同的东西。在这里，我们有一个向下看的相机
Here we have something a bit different. Here we have a single camera looking downwards

98
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:52,389
在珊瑚礁，摄像机由机器人携带。现在我们可以使用一个数字
at a coral reef, and the camera is being carried by a robot. Now we are able to use a number

99
00:08:52,389 --> 00:08:57,189
数学技术结合来自这些多个摄像机视频的信息
of mathematical techniques to combine the information from these multiple camera videos

100
00:08:57,189 --> 00:09:03,279
创建珊瑚礁的三维模型。我们从一些单曲做到这一点
to create a three dimensional model of the coral reef. We do this from a number of single

101
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,040
相机视图。现在我们平滑那个三维网格;我们将原始图像覆盖在上面
camera views. Now we smooth that three dimensional mesh; we drape the original imagery over it

102
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:14,649
创建纹理贴图表面。所以现在我们有一个非常逼真的三维视觉
to create a texture map surface. So now we have a very realistic looking three dimensional

103
00:09:14,649 --> 00:09:22,499
从一系列单一摄像机视图中获得的珊瑚礁模型。
model of a coral reef obtained just from a whole sequence of single camera views.

104
00:09:22,499 --> 00:09:28,199
所以我希望我已经说服你，愿景是一个真正非常重要的传感器
So I hope that I have convinced you that vision is a really, really important sensor for all

105
00:09:28,199 --> 00:09:34,529
各种各样的动物，为自己和机器人。所以在本课程的其余部分我们是
sorts of animals, for ourselves and also for robots. So in the rest of the course we are

106
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:40,189
要了解我们如何做机器人视觉;我们如何从相机中获取信息
going to learn something about how we do robot vision; how do we take information from camera

107
00:09:40,189 --> 00:09:45,449
传感器并处理它并生成机器人可以采取某些行动的信息。
sensors and process it and generate information that a robot can take some action on.
