1
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:06,750
我们已经谈了一些人类视觉系统。我们来看看一些方式
We have talked a bit about the human visual system. Let’s have a look at the way some

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:10,612
其他动物做到了。考虑一下蜜蜂的情况。蜜蜂是一个
other animals do it. Consider the case of the bee. The bee is a

3
00:00:10,612 --> 00:00:15,360
非常小的动物，因此它有一个非常小的大脑。蜜蜂的大脑很重
very small animal and therefore it has got a very small brain. The bee’s brain weighs

4
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:21,239
只有一克，它只有10^6个神经元。因此，与人类大脑形成鲜明对比
just one gram and it has only got 10^6 neurons. So contrast that with the human brain, which

5
00:00:21,239 --> 00:00:27,869
有一个半公斤的灰质和10^11个神经元。蜜蜂的脑子要小得多，
has got one and a half kilograms of grey matter and 10^11 neurons. The bee brain is much smaller,

6
00:00:27,869 --> 00:00:34,440
更简单，但它仍然能够完成基于信息的非常复杂的任务
much simpler, yet it is still able to do very complex tasks based simply on the information

7
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,100
来自它的眼睛。现在我们有两只眼睛，蜜蜂有两只眼睛。
that comes from its eyes. Now we have two eyes and the bee has two eyes.

8
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:45,390
没有什么可以说所有的动物都必须有两只眼睛。所以这是一个接近
There is nothing that says that all animals have to have two eyes. So this is a close

9
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,309
一只蜘蛛，这只特殊的蜘蛛有四只眼睛，我觉得有一些
up of a spider and this particular spider has got four eyes and I think there are some

10
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:57,390
有五只眼睛的蜘蛛。因此，进化已经出现了许多不同的设计
spiders that have got five eyes. So evolution has come up with many different designs of

11
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:03,149
眼睛本身和眼睛的配置，明显赋予一些特殊的优势
eyes themselves, and configurations of eyes, that clearly confer some particular advantage

12
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:08,880
对携带它们的有机体。这是近距离拍摄的眼睛
to the organism that is carrying them. Here is a close up photograph of the eyes

13
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:16,250
一只昆虫这些是复眼，由多个多边形面组成。
of an insect. These are compound eyes, made up of a number of polygonal facets.

14
00:01:16,250 --> 00:01:20,829
这是另一种复眼。这个没有相当的视野
Here is another type of compound eye. This one doesn’t have quite the field of view

15
00:01:20,829 --> 00:01:26,720
我们刚才看到的那个。这是鹦鹉螺的眼睛，这是相当的
of the one we just looked at. Here is the eye of a nautilus, which is quite

16
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:33,051
原始的远洋动物。而眼睛真的是一个非常简单的针孔相机;它
a primitive ocean-going animal. And the eye really is a very simple pinhole camera; it

17
00:01:33,051 --> 00:01:38,670
没有这样的镜头。这是扇贝的眼睛。所以蓝色
doesn’t have a lens as such. Here are the eyes of a scallop. So the blue

18
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:44,430
你可以看到的物体，每一个都是一个非常简单的眼睛，它有很多
objects that you can see, each of those is a very simple eye and it has got a large number

19
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:51,219
他们周围的东西实际上是它的嘴巴。这些眼睛中的每一个都有点像
of them around the outside of what is effectively its mouth. Each of these eyes is a bit like

20
00:01:51,219 --> 00:01:57,000
反射望远镜。那些蓝色物体的内部非常有光泽，因此传入
a reflecting telescope. The inside of those blue objects is quite shiny and so incoming

21
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,729
光线不是通过镜头折射而是从内部的光泽表面反射出来
light rays, instead of refracting in through a lens, reflect off the shiny surface inside

22
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:09,479
那只眼睛落在光感受器上。所以这个扇贝，它反而使用反射
that eye and fall onto the photoreceptors. So this scallop, it uses reflection rather

23
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,770
然后屈光，它有很多眼睛。
then refraction and it has got a very large number of eyes.

24
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:20,820
这是鱿鱼的眼睛，它像我们一样拥有一只眼睛，它已经进化了
This is the eye of a squid and it has got a lensed eye like we have, and it has evolved

25
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,140
完全独立于我们拥有的眼睛。
completely independently of the lensed eye that we have.

26
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:32,110
这是一只鸟的眼睛的近距离。昆虫中的复眼含有一种
And here is a close up of the eyes of a bird. The compound eye in the insect contains a

27
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:38,320
小平面数;个别光感应元素称为ommatidia，如果我们看一下
number of facets; individual light sensing elements called ommatidia and if we look at

28
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:43,550
它是欧亚大陆的一个横截面，它有效地在顶部有一个镜头，它可以任何漏斗
a cross-section of the ommatidia it has got effectively a lens on top which funnels any

29
00:02:43,550 --> 00:02:50,790
落在这个含有光敏化学物质的锥形细胞内的光线，
light that falls on it down inside this conical cell which contains the light sensitive chemicals,

30
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:56,900
当光落在它上面时会发出神经脉冲。所以每一个都是有效的
which emit a neural pulse when light falls on it. So each one of these is effectively

31
00:02:56,900 --> 00:03:02,360
单像素相机，或者我们可以用这些术语来思考它。我们有一个完整的阵列
a single pixel camera, or we can think of it in those terms. And we have a whole array

32
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:08,520
他们指向略微不同的方向，这使得昆虫可以创造一个公平的
of them pointing in slightly different directions and that allows the insect to create a fairly

33
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,040
大视野。
large field of view.
