1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,720
让我们回顾一下我们在这个特定讲座中涉及的一些主要概念。
Let’s recap some of the main concepts we have covered in this particular lecture.

2
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,180
我们想解释颜色的概念来自哪里，这是一个多步骤的过程。
We want to explain where the idea of color comes from and it’s a multi-step process.

3
00:00:13,190 --> 00:00:17,950
这个过程的第一步是光源;那是发光的物体
The first step in the process is the illuminant; that is the object that emits light which

4
00:00:17,950 --> 00:00:23,380
落到了现场。那个入射光我们称之为照度和它的种类
falls onto the scene. That incoming light we refer to as illuminance and it’s kind

5
00:00:23,380 --> 00:00:29,550
频谱;它是波长的函数，我们用字母E表示它。那个光
of a spectrum; it is a function of the wavelength and we refer to it by the letter E. That light

6
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,180
落在一个物体上，物体的反射率也是一个功能波长，
falls onto an object, and the object has got a reflectance which is also a functional wavelength,

7
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:40,109
所以红色物体反射更多的红光和其他种类的光。一个蓝色物体会
so a red object reflects more red light and other sorts of light. A blue object would

8
00:00:40,109 --> 00:00:45,030
反射更蓝光然后其他种类的光。离开物体的光我们
reflect more blue light then other kinds of light. The light that leaves the object we

9
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:51,190
“亮度”是指亮度，物体的亮度和亮度的光谱
refer to as the luminance, the luminance of the object, and the spectrum of the luminance

10
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:56,469
是照度，入射光和反射光谱的函数
is a function of the spectrum of the illuminance, the incoming light and the reflectance of

11
00:00:56,469 --> 00:01:00,469
物体。那光线进入观察者的视线，
the object. That light enters the eye of an observer,

12
00:01:00,469 --> 00:01:05,630
在观察者眼睛后面的观察者中有许多不同的观察者
and within the observer at the back of the observer’s eye are a number of different

13
00:01:05,630 --> 00:01:11,580
光敏感细胞-它们有不同的反应，它们对不同部位有反应
light sensitive cells—they have different responses and they respond to different parts

14
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:17,450
光谱。这些锥细胞的响应用N表示，它是一个函数
of the spectrum. The response of theses cone cells is denoted by N and it is a function

15
00:01:17,450 --> 00:01:23,680
兰达不同的锥细胞具有不同的Ns。整体反应
of lambda. The different cone cells have got different Ns. The overall response of the

16
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:29,220
锥形细胞是入射光光谱波长的积分
cone cell is the integral over the wavelength of the spectrum of the incoming light, the

17
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:35,760
物体的反射率，以及单个锥体细胞的响应。在锥体内
reflectance of the object, and the response of the individual cone cell. Within the cone

18
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:40,790
细胞通过化学反应将光子转换成行进的电脉冲
cell the photons are converted via a chemical reaction to electrical impulses which travel

19
00:01:40,790 --> 00:01:46,870
通过观察者的视觉皮层，它们会产生我们的感觉
through to visual cortex of the observer, and they result in a sensation that we have

20
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:52,050
学会了与红字联系起来。我们有许多光源
learned to associate with the word red. There are many sources of light and we have

21
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:57,360
触及其中一些。白炽度是热物体可以接受的光
touched on some of these. Incandescence is the light admitted by hot objects that could

22
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,550
是钨灯泡的白热灯丝，也可能是太阳。其他来源
be the white hot filament of a tungsten light bulb or it could be the sun. Other sources

23
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:09,200
光是电子刺激，如在旧式阴极射线管中发生的那样，光线允许
of light are electron stimulation as occurs in old fashion cathode ray tubes, light admitting

24
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:15,640
二极管，紧凑型荧光灯管和其他气体放电管和激光器。每一个
diodes, compact fluorescent tubes and other gas discharged tubes and lasers. Each of these

25
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:22,260
具有不同的亮度光谱。光是电磁辐射的一种形式
has a different luminance spectrum. Light is a form of electromagnetic radiation and

26
00:02:22,260 --> 00:02:28,629
这种辐射在波长方面有所不同。用我们的眼睛，我们只能看到它
this radiation varies in terms of its wavelength. With our eyes we are only able to see that

27
00:02:28,629 --> 00:02:35,170
部分电磁波谱，但波长在400到700纳米之间
part of the electromagnetic spectrum, but with wavelengths between 400 and 700 nanometers

28
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:41,310
普通光源发出的光很多-尤其是太阳和白炽灯泡
a lot of light emitted by common light sources—particularly the sun and incandescent light bulbs—is

29
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:44,459
在光谱的红外线部分，虽然我们看不到
in the infra-red part of the spectrum, and although we can’t see

30
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:48,819
红外线，我们可以感受到它。我们可以把它感觉为热量。
infra-red we can feel it. We can sense it as heat.

31
00:02:48,819 --> 00:02:53,799
在我们眼睛的视网膜中，我们有大量的光敏细胞：有
In the retina of our eyes we have a large number of light sensitive cells: there are

32
00:02:53,799 --> 00:02:59,299
杆细胞和锥细胞。现在正是锥形细胞给我们带来了色觉。
rod cells and cone cells. Now it is the cone cells that give us our sense of color vision.

33
00:02:59,299 --> 00:03:04,389
有三种不同类型的视锥细胞：对红色敏感的视锥细胞
There are three different types of cone cells: those that are sensitive to red, those that

34
00:03:04,389 --> 00:03:08,999
对绿色敏感，对蓝色敏感。他们经常被提及
are sensitive to green and those that are sensitive to blue. Often times they are referred

35
00:03:08,999 --> 00:03:16,120
作为短，中，长波长锥体。锥体有些重叠
to as the short, medium and long wavelength cones. The cones have somewhat overlapping

36
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:21,230
响应函数;特别是，红色和绿色锥体显着重叠。
response functions; in particular, the red and green cones are significantly overlapped.

37
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:25,779
我们有三种类型的锥体这一事实意味着我们被称为trichromats-we
The fact that we have three types of cones means that we are called trichromats—we

38
00:03:25,779 --> 00:03:32,019
有三色视觉。并非所有动物都有三色视觉;大多数哺乳动物只有
have three-color vision. Not all animals have three-color vision; most mammals only have

39
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:37,219
双色视觉。我们称它们为重铬酸盐。许多其他动物都有四色视觉。
two-color vision. We call them dichromats. Many other animals have four-color vision.

40
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:42,120
我们称它们为四色，鸟类就是典型的例子。
We call them tetrachromats and birds are a typical example of that.

41
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,540
当我们制作相机时，我们借用了很多这些原理;我们有一个底层数组
When we create cameras, we borrow a lot of these principles; we have an underlying array

42
00:03:47,540 --> 00:03:52,419
有机硅光电传感器，每个都对各种颜色敏感。
of silicone photo sensors and each of those are sensitive to a wide range of colors.

43
00:03:52,419 --> 00:03:57,029
为了使它们对颜色敏感，我们在它们上面打印彩色滤光片，通常在a
To make them color sensitive we print color filters on top of them and generally in a

44
00:03:57,029 --> 00:04:02,269
2乘2阵列我们称之为拜耳模式，因此每2乘2阵列包含两个
2 by 2 array which we refer to as the Bayer pattern, so each 2 by 2 array contains two

45
00:04:02,269 --> 00:04:07,930
绿色滤镜和红色滤镜和蓝色滤镜。所以我们在硅胶中创造了一种类似物
green filters and a red filter and a blue filter. So we create in silicone an analogue

46
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:11,799
人眼中的颜色传感机制。
of the color sensing mechanism in the human eye.

47
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:17,609
如果我看一个具有特定颜色的物体，我会改变照明的强度
If I look at an object with a particular color and I change the intensity of the illumination

48
00:04:17,609 --> 00:04:23,220
对象的外观会发生变化，这里我们看到对象的例子
the appearance of the object will change, and here we see examples of the object at

49
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:30,560
亮度为100％，75％，50％和0％。RGB值正在变化，但颜色却在变化
100%, 75%, 50% and 0% brightness. The RGB values are changing, but the color of the

50
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:37,780
对象本身并没有改变，所以我们想找到一种方法来解决颜色与强度的关系。
object itself does not change, so we want to find a way to disentangle color from intensity.

51
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,770
要映射我们称之为三刺激值的三个-即红色，绿色和蓝色
To map the three what we call tristimulus values—that is, the red, green and blue

52
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:47,229
将值转换为亮度值和两个颜色值-现在我们可以非常简单地执行此操作
value into a brightness value and two color values—now we can do this very simply by

53
00:04:47,229 --> 00:04:52,400
将RGB值转换为我们称之为色度坐标的值，由下式表示
converting the RGB values to what we call chromaticity coordinates, indicated by the

54
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,440
小写r，g和b。现在这三个数字实际上是多余的。我可以计算任何
lower case r, g and b. Now these three numbers are actually redundant. I can compute any

55
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,310
其中一个给了另外两个，所以我们只需要使用其中两个，通常我们保留
one of them given the other two, so we only need to use two of them and typically we keep

56
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:08,379
只有R和G，这些数字在0和1之间变化。
only R and G, these numbers vary between zero and one.

57
00:05:08,379 --> 00:05:13,680
因此，如果我们在水平轴上绘制一个图形，我们在垂直方向上有r坐标
So if we make a graph where on the horizontal axis we have the r coordinate, on the vertical

58
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,380
我们有g坐标，然后每个可能的颜色出现在这个三角形内
axis we have the g coordinate, then every possible color appears within this triangle

59
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:25,560
......纯红色出现在这里，纯绿色出现在这里，纯蓝色出现在这里，
… pure red appears here, pure green appears here, pure blue appears here,

60
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,780
并且任何颜色都不可能存在于蓝线上方。
and it is not possible for any colors to exist above the blue line.
