1
00:00:02,629 --> 00:00:04,905
这个过程的最后一部分是什么
the last part of the process is what

2
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:08,295
在我们的观察者眼中继续
goes on in the eyes of the observer we

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:11,145
将此称为响应等
refer to this as the response and like

4
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:13,214
响应的一切都是
everything else the response is a

5
00:00:13,219 --> 00:00:16,185
波长λ的函数
function of the wavelength lambda in

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,835
事实上可以写出这个回应
fact the response can be written this

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,354
这是波长的积分
way it is the integral over wavelengths

8
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:23,174
光的入射光谱
of the spectrum of the incoming light of

9
00:00:23,179 --> 00:00:26,415
反射率和反应
the reflectance and of the response of

10
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:28,934
那个特别的光明之眼
the eye to light at that particular

11
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:31,655
波长所以我们所感受到的
wavelength so what we sense in the

12
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:33,675
我们背后的感光细胞
photoreceptor cells in the back of our

13
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:36,705
眼睛基本上就是这样的结果
eye is essentially the result of this

14
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,835
特别是积分让我们看看如何
particular integral let's see how that

15
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:41,955
这里的作品是一张剖面图
works here is a cutaway diagram of the

16
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:44,025
我们眼睛后方的人眼
human eye at the back of the eye we have

17
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:46,245
视网膜我们正在看表面
the retina we're looking at the surface

18
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:48,315
视网膜我们看到很多血
of the retina we see a lot of blood

19
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:50,865
血管，我们可以看到视神经
vessels and we can see the optic nerve

20
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,085
这是将眼睛与我们联系起来的东西
which is what connects the eye to our

21
00:00:53,090 --> 00:00:56,205
如果我们采取横截面通过大脑
brain if we take a cross-section through

22
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:58,394
视网膜在那里切片
the retina where to slice through there

23
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:00,615
我们向下看，我们看到有
we look downwards we see that there are

24
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,835
神经层和其他类型的
layers of nerves and other sorts of

25
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,475
细胞和在这个堆栈的底部我们
cells and at the bottom of this stack we

26
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:08,445
有光敏细胞和它们
have the light-sensitive cells and they

27
00:01:08,450 --> 00:01:10,004
看起来像这样
look something like this

28
00:01:10,009 --> 00:01:12,195
所以令人惊讶的是
so what's quite surprising is that the

29
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:14,175
光敏细胞不在
light-sensitive cells are not on the

30
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:16,335
他们实际上是视网膜的表面
surface of the retina they are actually

31
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,065
在表面下约500微米
about 500 micrometers below the surface

32
00:01:19,070 --> 00:01:21,434
视网膜，所以光线落在上面
of the retina so the light that falls on

33
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:23,474
视网膜必须向下挣扎
the retina has to fight its way down

34
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:25,544
通过血管和神经细胞
through blood vessels and nerve cells

35
00:01:25,549 --> 00:01:27,645
以及各种各样的事情
and all sorts of things to get to the

36
00:01:27,650 --> 00:01:30,525
光敏棒和锥形细胞让我们
light-sensitive rod and cone cells let's

37
00:01:30,530 --> 00:01:32,595
看看他们就是这些杆细胞
look at the rod cells they're these

38
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:36,015
我们看到的小虫形物体
small worm shaped objects that we see in

39
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,465
他们包含视网膜的背面
the back of the retina they contain a

40
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:42,254
化学物质叫做视紫红质，相当
chemical called rhodopsin and is quite

41
00:01:42,259 --> 00:01:44,114
一个重要的化学品，因为当a
an important chemical because when a

42
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:46,425
光子照射它会改变它
photon of light hits it it changes its

43
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,214
形状从它改变形状
shape it changes its shape from this to

44
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:51,074
我们可以看到它的一只手臂
that and we can see the one arm of the

45
00:01:51,079 --> 00:01:53,894
事实上，分子是被旋转的
molecule is in fact being spun around by

46
00:01:53,899 --> 00:01:56,235
光子的影响就是这样
the impact of the photon and that is

47
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:58,245
最终转变为电气
eventually converted into an electrical

48
00:01:58,250 --> 00:02:00,345
沿光学传播的信号

50
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,894
杆细胞非常敏感
the rod cells are very very sensitive to

51
00:02:05,899 --> 00:02:08,385
因此这些是我们使用的细胞
light so these are the cells we use in

52
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,785
我们使用的低光条件
low-light conditions what we use at

53
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:13,155
晚上和他们有线的方式

54
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,065
他们也非常敏感
them also very sensitive to

55
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:16,655
这是我们用来确定的
that's what we use to determine

56
00:02:16,660 --> 00:02:18,995
一些东西在我们的边缘移动
something's moving in the edge of our

57
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,395

00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:29,885
这是杆的响应曲线
this is the response curve of the rod

61
00:02:29,890 --> 00:02:32,675
细胞我们用符号M表示它
cells and we denote it by the symbol M

62
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,835
它当然是一个功能
and it of course is a function of

63
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,535

波长和长波长
wavelength and long wavelength

99
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:04,265
我们也将它们称为蓝绿色和
we'd also refer them as blue green and

00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:26,135
在上一张幻灯片中，让我们看看更多
in the previous slide let's look more

108
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,645
紧靠视网膜
closely at the retina

109
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:30,255
并且有两个关键的地标
and there are two key landmarks in the

110
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:32,055
视网膜一是我们所说的中央凹
retina one is what we call the fovea

111
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:34,035
我们集中精力的地方
where we have an enormous concentration

112
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:37,155
光敏细胞和另一个
of light-sensitive cells and the other

113
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,435
光学所在的大地标
big landmark which is where the optic

114
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:41,865
神经加入视网膜，该区域有
nerve joins the retina and that area has

115
00:04:41,870 --> 00:04:44,085
几乎没有光敏细胞
almost no light sensitive cells exactly

116
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:47,505
你眼中的一个盲点，如果我们
a blind spot in your eye so if we

117
00:04:47,510 --> 00:04:49,845
预测这两点我们
project those two points down and we

118
00:04:49,850 --> 00:04:54,405
绘制一个我们可以绘制的轴
draw an axis we can plot the

119
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:57,585
锥细胞密度的浓度
concentration for density of cone cells

120
00:04:57,590 --> 00:05:01,605
作为角度的函数远离
as a function of angle away from the

121
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,155
我们有一方的中央凹等等
fovea and so on one side we have the

122
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,194
另一方面，你的耳朵方向
direction towards your ear on the other

123
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:08,055
我们有朝向你的方向
side we have the direction towards your

124
00:05:08,060 --> 00:05:09,884
鼻子，我们可以看到有一个巨大的
nose and we can see there's an enormous

125
00:05:09,889 --> 00:05:12,765
中央凹区锥体的浓度
concentration of cones in the fovea area

126
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:15,015
并且浓度低得多
and a much lower concentration of cone

127
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:17,534
在你的眼睛的细胞我们是什么

128
00:05:17,539 --> 00:05:19,784
如果我们打电话给周边视野区域
call the peripheral vision area if we

129
00:05:19,789 --> 00:05:21,795
现在看看杆细胞的分布
look now the distribution of rod cells

130
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:24,675
我们看到几乎与我们看到的相反
we see almost the converse we see that

131
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,805
在这里有很多杆细胞
there are very many rod cells in the

132
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,175
视力的周边部分不是太多
peripheral part of vision not too many

133
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:31,724
在你的恐惧症中它们都是如此
of them at all in your phobia so the

134
00:05:31,729 --> 00:05:33,825
我们的浓度非常高
fovea we have a very high concentration

135
00:05:33,830 --> 00:05:36,435
其余的颜色敏感细胞
of color sensitive cells the rest of the

136
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,295
眼睛里有大量的细胞

138
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:41,589
but don't distinguish between different

139
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,990
但不要区分不同
