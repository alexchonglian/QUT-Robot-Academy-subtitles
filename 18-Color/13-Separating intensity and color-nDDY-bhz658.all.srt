1
00:00:04,029 --> 00:00:08,780
考虑一下我们正在查看此对象。它被白光源照亮
Consider that we are viewing this object. It is being illuminated by a white light source

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:16,289
并且相机返回这些RGB值或三刺激值。想象一下，现在
and the camera is returning these RGB values or tristimulus values. Imagine now that the

3
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:22,029
白光源的强度正在降低。我们观察到的是外观
intensity of the white light source is being reduced. What we observe is that the appearance

4
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:27,340
对象的变化但很明显，对象本身的颜色不能改变，因为
of the object changes but clearly the color of the object itself cannot change because

5
00:00:27,340 --> 00:00:33,540
颜色是物体的物质属性-苹果即使在黑暗中仍然是红色的
the color is a material property of the object — an apple is still red, even if it is in a dark

6
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:40,519
房间-而我们观察到的是，随着照明水平降低了三刺激
room — and what we observe is that as the lighting level has been reduced the tristimulus

7
00:00:40,519 --> 00:00:45,890
价值观发生了变化它们都变小了，但三刺激之间的比例
values have changed; they have all become smaller, but the ratio between the tristimulus

8
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:51,269
值保持不变，我们想要做的是找到一些转换方法
values remains the same and what we would like to do is to find some way to transform

9
00:00:51,269 --> 00:00:58,129
三个三刺激值到一个亮度值，也许两个颜色值。
the three tristimulus values to one brightness value and perhaps two color values.

10
00:00:58,129 --> 00:01:03,960
一种方法是将RGB值转换为色度坐标和我们
One way to do this is to transform the RGB values into chromaticity coordinates and we

11
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:10,990
将RGB值除以总和，通过总三刺激，我们最终得到这些变量，
divide the RGB values by the sum, by the total tristimulus, we end up with these variables,

12
00:01:10,990 --> 00:01:16,890
小R，小G和小B.并且很容易证明这些在零之间变化
little R, little G and little B. And it is easy to show that these vary between zero

13
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:22,869
一个。它也很容易证明它们总和为一。因此，其中一个坐标
and one. It is also easy to show that they sum to one. Therefore, one of the coordinates

14
00:01:22,869 --> 00:01:27,860
是多余的，通常我们只考虑小R和小G值。
is redundant and typically we consider just the little R and little G values.

15
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:32,649
考虑这个有效的例子，类似于我们之前看过的事情：白光下降
Consider this worked example, similar to things we have looked at before: white light falling

16
00:01:32,649 --> 00:01:37,960
在红苹果上产生这种三刺激值。现在考虑有一个云
on to a red apple and producing this tristimulus value. Now consider that there is a cloud

17
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,930
在光源前面，整体照度水平已经降低了
in front of the light source, the overall illumination level has been reduced and the

18
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:49,009
三刺激值现在具有不同的值，比我们之前的三刺激值更小。
tristimulus value now has a different value, smaller tristimulus value then we had before.

19
00:01:49,009 --> 00:01:53,799
让我们考虑一个有效的例子：在第一种情况下，我们可以计算色度
Let’s consider a worked example: in the first case we can compute the chromaticity

20
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:58,460
小R和小G的坐标。对于有云的第二种情况
coordinates of little R and little G. For the second case where there was a cloud in

21
00:01:58,460 --> 00:02:03,710
在光源前面，降低整体照度，我们可以计算色度坐标
front of the light source, lower overall illumination, we can compute the chromaticity coordinates

22
00:02:03,710 --> 00:02:07,719
我们可以看到它们是相同的，我们能够做的就是要考虑因素
and we can see that they are the same and what we have been able to do then is to factor

23
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:14,489
消除强度的影响，只保留两个数字，提供一些表示
out the effect of intensity and retain just two numbers which provide some representation

24
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:17,319
的颜色。我们考虑一个二维坐标
of color. Let’s consider a two dimensional coordinate

25
00:02:17,319 --> 00:02:23,500
轴小R和小G的系统。这个点R等于1，G等于
system with the axis little R and little G. This point where R equals one and G equals

26
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:29,840
没有对应纯红色。其中R等于零，G等于一等于纯
nought corresponds to pure red. Where R equals nought and G equals one corresponds to pure

27
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:35,750
绿色和此点在R和G都等于零的原点对应
green and this point at the origin where R and G are both equal to zero corresponds to

28
00:02:35,750 --> 00:02:39,560
纯蓝色。色度坐标是不可能的
pure blue. It is not possible for a chromaticity coordinate

29
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:44,430
存在于蓝线上方的空间中，这来自于很少的约束
to exist in the space above the blue line and this comes from the constraint that little

30
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:48,269
R，加上小G，加上小B必须等于1。
R, plus little G, plus little B has to equal one.

31
00:02:48,269 --> 00:02:54,480
在之前的一个讲座中，我们讨论了伽玛编码的概念，这就是有一个
In an earlier lecture we discussed the concept of gamma encoding this is where there is a

32
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,360
进入相机的光的亮度与幅度之间的非线性变换
non-linear transformation between the brightness of the light entering the camera and the magnitude

33
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:06,080
离开相机的信号今天几乎所有相机都有伽玛编码
of the signal leaving the camera. Almost all cameras today have gamma encoding in them

34
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:14,340
伽玛值通常约为2.2。伽玛编码对色度有何影响
and the gamma value is typically around 2.2. What effect does gamma encoding have on chromaticity

35
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,959
坐标？我们将用另一个有用的例子说明这一点。
coordinates? We will illustrate this with another worked example.

36
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:24,159
我们将使用前面示例中的三刺激或RGB值与完整的太阳
We will use the tristimulus or RGB values from the earlier example with the full sun

37
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:30,549
和阴云密布的太阳照射，第一步是计算伽玛编码的RGB值，
and the clouded sun illumination and the first step is to compute the gamma encoded RGB values,

38
00:03:30,549 --> 00:03:35,640
它们在这里显示，我们可以使用MATLAB非常方便地完成这项工作。
and they are shown here, and we can do this very easily and conveniently using MATLAB.

39
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,819
现在让我们计算色度坐标，在第一种情况下，它是用于完全照明
Now let’s compute the chromaticity coordinates and in the first case it is for the full illumination

40
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:47,680
条件，这里是R和G值。对于低照度的第二种情况，
condition and here are the R and G values. For the second case with lower illumination,

41
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:51,709
我们计算色度坐标，我们看到它们与第一个相同
we compute the chromaticity coordinates and we see they are the same as for the first

42
00:03:51,709 --> 00:03:57,780
案件。所以我们再一次考虑了照明的影响，我们留下了
case. So once again we have factored out the effect of illumination and we are left with

43
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:03,530
两个代表颜色的数字。对于这种使用伽玛编码的情况，我们已经考虑了因素
two numbers which represent the color. For this case with gamma encoding, we have factored

44
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:08,860
效果照明，这是一件好事。但实际的色度坐标
out the effect illumination and that is a good thing. But the actual chromaticity coordinates

45
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:13,760
与我们之前在没有伽玛编码的情况下计算的情况具有不同的值。
have a different value to the case we computed earlier without gamma encoding.
