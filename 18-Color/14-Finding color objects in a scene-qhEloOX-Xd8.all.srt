1
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:06,769
让我们用现实世界的图像将其中的一部分付诸实践。
Let’s put some of this into practice with a real world image.

2
00:00:06,769 --> 00:00:15,700
我将在实验室中加载一个包含一些西红柿的场景图像，
I am going to load an image of a scene that comprises some tomatoes on a bush in a lab,

3
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:21,020
我将转换图像，以便像素在MATLAB中存储为double
and I am going to convert the image so that the pixels are stored inside MATLAB as double

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,390
精确数字。
precision numbers.

5
00:00:22,390 --> 00:00:30,720
所以我们可以看一下广告中的图像：它里面有一些西红柿
So we can have a look at the image as advertised: it contains some tomatoes on a bush inside

6
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,050
实验室-实际上在麻省理工学院。
a lab — at MIT, actually.

7
00:00:32,050 --> 00:00:38,149
如果我点击图像，我们可以看到番茄中的像素已经相当
If I click around on the image we can see that the pixels in the tomato have got quite

8
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:42,809
大量的红色，65％的红色，绿色不多，蓝色不多。
a large amount of red, 65 per cent red, not much green, not much blue.

9
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:48,829
现在，叶子，例如茎，含有比红色或蓝色更多的绿色。
Now the leaves, the stems for instance, contain more green than they do red or blue.

10
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:53,920
番茄图像很有趣;西红柿实际上非常有光泽，如果我点击一下
The tomato images are interesting; the tomatoes are actually quite shiny and if I click around

11
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,949
在这里，我们看到该值实际上更接近白色而不是红色。
here we see that the value is actually closer to white than it is to red.

12
00:00:58,949 --> 00:01:03,170
这个区域在这里我们称之为镜面高光。
This region here we refer to as a specular highlight.

13
00:01:03,170 --> 00:01:08,409
发生的事情是房间内的明亮光线从表面反射出来
What has happened is that bright light within the room is reflecting off the surface of

14
00:01:08,409 --> 00:01:14,659
西红柿是一种镜面而不是淡化的方式，在这种情况下，光没有
the tomato in a specular rather than a defuse fashion and in this case the light has not

15
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:18,140
拿起水果的颜色，基本上我们在这里看到的是颜色
picked up the color of the fruit, it is basically what we are seeing here is the color of the

16
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:19,659
光源本身。
light source itself.

17
00:01:19,659 --> 00:01:26,619
我们已经讨论了几次伽玛编码信息的过程
We have talked a couple of times already about the process of gamma encoding the information

18
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:28,579
在文件中的图像内。
within an image in a file.

19
00:01:28,579 --> 00:01:34,359
但我想要做的是取消伽玛编码;我想应用伽玛
But what I would like to do is to undo that gamma encoding; I would like to apply a gamma

20
00:01:34,359 --> 00:01:39,229
校正或伽玛解码，我可以通过传入iread功能
correction or gamma decoding and I can do that with the iread function by passing in

21
00:01:39,229 --> 00:01:44,390
一个额外的参数，并传递我想要应用的伽玛值
an extra argument and passing in the gamma value that I would like to have applied to

22
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:45,929
每个像素。
every pixel.

23
00:01:45,929 --> 00:01:52,569
因此，这将消除相机观察到的亮度之间的非线性
So this will eliminate the non-linearity between the luminance that the camera observed and

24
00:01:52,569 --> 00:01:57,380
我在MATLAB工作区中的像素值。
the pixel values that I have in my MATLAB workspace.

25
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:02,170
如果我显示这个经过伽马校正的图像，我们会发现它看起来很不寻常
If I display this gamma corrected image we will see that it looks rather unusual, it

26
00:02:02,170 --> 00:02:06,970
看起来实际上非常黑暗，正如之前所解释的那样，这里发生了什么
looks actually quite dark and as explained before what has happened here is that the

27
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:09,790
伽马校正现已应用两次。
gamma correction has now been applied twice.

28
00:02:09,790 --> 00:02:14,790
我已经在软件和我正在查看图像的显示器上应用了一次
I have applied it once in software and the monitor that I am looking at the image on

29
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,370
也正在应用伽马校正。
is also applying the gamma correction.

30
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:21,709
因此，我工作区中的值现在是线性的，这看起来并不正确
So it doesn’t look right that the values that I have in my workspace are now linearly

31
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:25,709
与进入镜头镜头的光有关。
related to the light that went into the lens of the camera.

32
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:30,530
所以接下来我要做的就是显示一个颜色平面
So the next thing that I would like to do is just to display one of the color planes

33
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:31,530
在这张图片中。
in this image.

34
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:38,070
所以让我们显示红色的飞机，它就在这里，我们可以看到番茄
So let’s display the red plane and here it is here, and we can see that the tomato

35
00:02:38,070 --> 00:02:42,760
水果在这里看起来很明亮，因为它们反射了大量的红光，而在
fruits are looking quite bright here because they reflect a lot of red light, whereas in

36
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,870
绿色的飞机，我们看到水果看起来非常，非常，黑暗。
the green plane we see that the fruit looks very, very, dark.

37
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,000
我们将颜色值分开。
Let’s separate out the color values.

38
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:55,629
我将创建一个名为R的新工作区变量，其中包含每行中的像素
I am going to create a new workspace variable called R which contains pixels in every row

39
00:02:55,629 --> 00:02:58,599
以及属于第一个平面的每一列。
and every column that belong to plane one.

40
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:04,060
我将为绿色飞机做类似的事情，我将做类似的事情
I am going to do a similar thing for the green plane and I am going to do a similar thing

41
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:08,810
对于蓝色平面，即3号平面。
for the blue plane, which is plane number 3.

42
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:14,640
所以，例如，我可以再次显示我刚刚计算的绿色平面。
So, for instance, I can just display again the green plane that I just computed.

43
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:18,909
现在我要做的下一件事是计算色度坐标和
Now the next thing that I want to do is to compute the chromaticity coordinates and to

44
00:03:18,909 --> 00:03:23,819
这样做我需要计算红色和绿色和蓝色的总和，我要去
do that I need to compute the sum of the red and the green and the blue and I am going

45
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:27,870
把它放入名为Y的局部变量中。
to put that into the local variable called Y.

46
00:03:27,870 --> 00:03:33,400
Y是用于所谓亮度图像的常用符号;这是一张单色图片
Y is a common symbol used for what is called the luminance image; it’s a monochrome image

47
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,400
其实。
actually.

48
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,719
如果我们现在看一下它会看起来像单色或黑白图片
If we look at this now it will look something like a monochrome or black and white picture

49
00:03:38,719 --> 00:03:39,719
现场。
of the scene.

50
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:42,650
它是所有颜色通道的平均值。
It is the average of all of the color channels.

51
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:48,900
现在，色度坐标计算出所有像素之间的比率
Now the chromaticity coordinates computes the ratio between all of the pixels in the

52
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:54,849
红色平面和总和，我可以使用MATLAB计算这个元素明智的划分
red plane and the sum and I can compute this element wise division by using the MATLAB

53
00:03:54,849 --> 00:03:59,660
运算符点斜杠，所以它要做的是计算一个新的图像，调用它
operator dot slash, so what it is going to do is to compute a new image, call it little

54
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:05,719
R，其尺寸与资本R和资本Y的尺寸相同。
R, and its dimensions will be the same as the dimensions of capital R and capital Y.

55
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:12,219
图像中的每个元素littleR是大写R中的对应像素除以
Each element of the image little R is the corresponding pixel in capital R divided by

56
00:04:12,219 --> 00:04:14,469
大写字母Y中的相应像素。
the corresponding pixel in capital Y.

57
00:04:14,469 --> 00:04:19,440
让我为绿色色度通道做同样的事情;我们来看一下
And let me do the same thing for the green chromaticity channel; let’s have a look

58
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:20,510
在这些。
at these.

59
00:04:20,510 --> 00:04:25,100
这些存储在MATLAB工作空间矩阵中，但我当然可以显示矩阵
These are stored in the MATLAB workspaces matrices, but of course I can display a matrix

60
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:32,500
作为图像和图像被表示为矩阵，所以这里是小R，我可以创建
as an image and an image is represented as a matrix, so here is little R and I can create

61
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:39,670
另一个图，图二，在图二中，我将显示小G.
another figure, figure two, and in figure two I am going to display little G.

62
00:04:39,670 --> 00:04:45,390
所以这些是色度值，如果我们在这里探讨一些值
So these are the chromaticity values, and if we poke around some of the values here

63
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:51,530
我们可以看到水果在哪里，它有很大的R值，它有一个非常的
we can see that where the fruit is, it has got quite a large value of R, it has a very

64
00:04:51,530 --> 00:04:54,000
小G.的小值
small value of little G.

65
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:58,560
如果我们看一下叶子的哪个位置，我们就会看到它们具有适度的值
If we look at where some of the leaves are we see that they have got a modest value of

66
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:07,030
小R-约0.39-和小G有一个稍大的值，所以这两个图像
little R—about 0.39—and little G has got a slightly bigger value, so these two images

67
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:10,860
代表这个场景中的颜色：我们已经考虑了强度。
represent the color in this scene: we have factored out the intensity.

68
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:16,721
现在让我们说我们想制定一个可以选择属于的像素的规则
So let’s say now that we wanted to make a rule that would select a pixel that belonged

69
00:05:16,721 --> 00:05:19,890
对水果而言并不属于任何其他事物。
to the fruit and didn’t belong to anything else.

70
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:25,600
很明显，我们想要一条规则来说明R似乎很大的事实
Well clearly we want a rule that said something about the fact that R is quite big, it seems

71
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:33,080
至少大于0.8，大多数是0.9以上，但保守地说，
to be at least greater than 0.8 and mostly it is above 0.9, but let’s say, conservatively,

72
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:40,160
它必须高于0.8，在这种情况下，我们希望G值必须非常小。
it has to be above 0.8 and in this case we want the G value has to be quite small.

73
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,100
你应该知道，甚至不到0.1。
Has to be sort of, you know, less than 0.1 even.

74
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:46,340
但保守一点，我们说它必须小于0.2。
But to be conservative, let’s say it has to be less than 0.2.

75
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:52,340
所以我可以创建一个新变量，它将成为一个逻辑变量，所以我要去
So I could create a new variable, it is going to be a logical variable, so I am going to

76
00:05:52,340 --> 00:06:03,380
如果R大于0.8且G小于0.2，那么它就是真的。
say anywhere that R is greater than 0.8 and G is less than 0.2 it will be true.

77
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:08,790
所以让我们显示我刚刚创建的名为Tom的图像，我们就拥有了它。
So let’s display this image I just created called Tom and there we have it.

78
00:06:08,790 --> 00:06:12,870
这里的背景，这些值都是零，它们都是假的，在这里它们
The background here, these values are all zero, they are all false and in here they

79
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:17,880
都具有一个值，这是MATLAB表示真实概念的方式。
all have values of one, which is MATLAB’s way of representing the concept of true.

80
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:23,590
我们现在创建了一个二进制图像，如果它们是番茄果实，则像素为1
We have created now a binary image where the pixels are one if they are the tomato fruit

81
00:06:23,590 --> 00:06:29,420
如果它不是水果，背景，人和叶子，它们就是零。
and they are zero if it is not the fruit, background, people and leaves.

82
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:34,090
现在我们有了二进制图像，我们可以做很多我们之前演示过的事情
Now that we have a binary image we can do a lot of the things that we demonstrated earlier

83
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:36,960
当我们谈论二元视觉时。
when we were talking about binary vision.

84
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:42,960
所以我可以找到这个图像中的所有blob，所以我应用了iblobs
So I could look for all of the blobs that are within this image so I apply the iblobs

85
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,930
功能到我们刚刚计算的二进制图像，在这里，它有十个blob
function to the binary image we just computed and here it is, that there are ten blobs in

86
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:48,930
这里。
here.

87
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:52,500
现在，显然有几个大斑点，我们可以看到那里，有一些斑点
Now, there are clearly a couple of big blobs and we can see there, there are some blobs

88
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:56,940
面积相当大，周围也有很多非常非常小的斑点
with quite a large area and there is also a lot of very, very small blobs around the

89
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:59,180
其中一个水果的边缘。
edge of one of the fruit.

90
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:05,010
现在我们可以回到原始图像，让我们看看图一和那里
Now we can go back to the original image, let’s have a look at figure one and there

91
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:12,870
我将显示原始图像，然后我将覆盖一些边界框
I am going to display the original image and then I am going to overlay some bounding boxes

92
00:07:12,870 --> 00:07:16,340
然后我将它们覆盖在绿色中。
and I will overlay them in the color green.

93
00:07:16,340 --> 00:07:20,720
因此，我们有它;很简单，我们拍摄了彩色图像，我们已经计算了
So there we have it; quite simply, we have taken a color image, we have computed the

94
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,780
在色度坐标方面，每个像素的基本颜色。
essential color at each of the pixels in terms of chromaticity coordinates.

95
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,960
我们制定了一个非常简单的规则来选择属于水果的像素，而不是
We have made a very simple rule to choose pixels that belong to the fruit and not to

96
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:31,940
还要别的吗;这导致我们得到一个二进制图像。
anything else; that led us to a binary image.

97
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:35,430
一旦我们有了二进制图像，那么我们就可以应用我们已经拥有的所有技术
Once we have a binary image, then we can apply all of the techniques that we have already

98
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:40,140
我学会并以非常快速的方式概述了特定的水果。
learnt and in very quick fashion I can outline the particular fruit.

99
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:45,210
现在问题在于水果是一种畸形，其中一部分是因为
Now the problem with this is that the fruit are kind of misshapen, part of that is because

100
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:49,900
我之前提到过的镜面反射，以及一些水果都被模糊了
of the specular reflection that I mentioned earlier and also some of the fruit is obscured

101
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:55,210
通过树叶和其他任何东西，仍然是一个开始的边界框，我们可以看看
by leaves and whatever, still the bounding box is a good place to start, we could look

102
00:07:55,210 --> 00:08:00,360
在我们之前使用的一些数学形态学技术中，我们可以应用这些技术
at some of the mathematical morphology techniques that we used before, we could apply the techniques

103
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:05,740
膨胀和侵蚀可能填补了这些水果中一些缺失的部分。
of dilation and erosion perhaps to fill in some of the missing part of those fruit.
