1
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:06,300
让我们将彩色图像加载到我们的工作区中。
Let’s load a color image into our workspace.

2
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:13,010
我们将它放入名为im的变量中，并调用我要使用的图像
We’ll put it into the variable called im, and the image that I’m going to use is called

3
00:00:13,010 --> 00:00:16,309
flowers8，它是一个png格式文件。
flowers8 and it’s a png format file.

4
00:00:16,309 --> 00:00:20,869
所以这是随工具箱分发的文件之一。
So this is one of the files that’s distributed with the toolbox.

5
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:23,020
我们已将其加载到工作区中。
We have loaded it into the workspace.

6
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,600
现在再一次，这是一个无符号的8位整数图像。
Now once again this is an unsigned 8-bit integer image.

7
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,330
我们可以看到图像属于类uint8。
We can see that the image belongs to the class uint8.

8
00:00:31,330 --> 00:00:35,790
与我们之前看到的相比，这张图片的尺寸很有趣。
The dimensions of this image are interesting compared to what we’ve seen before.

9
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:42,809
我们看到这个有426行，640列和一个带有值的额外维度
We see that this one has got 426 rows, 640 columns and an extra dimension with a value

10
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:44,219
3。
of 3.

11
00:00:44,219 --> 00:00:49,749
我们将第二维称为平面，并且很快就会变得清晰。
We refer to the second dimension as the plane, and that will become clear shortly.

12
00:00:49,749 --> 00:00:53,819
我们要做的第一件事是显示图像，我们看到一张图片包含
First thing we’re going to do is to display the image and we see a picture containing

13
00:00:53,819 --> 00:00:55,929
一些彩色的花朵。
a number of colored flowers.

14
00:00:55,929 --> 00:01:01,129
现在，如果我点击一些像素值-我将点击这里的红色花-我们
Now if I click on some pixel values—I’m going to click here on this red flower—we

15
00:01:01,129 --> 00:01:04,930
看到它有一个有三个组件的像素值。
see that it has got a pixel value which has three components.

16
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:08,770
像素值实际上是一个矢量，这些数字表示红色的数量，
The pixel value is actually a vector, and those numbers indicate the amount of red,

17
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,530
绿色量，蓝色量。
the amount of green, the amount of blue.

18
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,540
所以我刚刚点了一朵红色的花，我们看到红色的数量是176，而且这个
So I’ve just clicked on a red flower and we see that the red amount is 176, and this

19
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:17,460
非常重要。
is quite significant.

20
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:20,160
请记住，8位无符号整数从最小值开始
Remember, 8-bit unsigned integers go from a minimum

21
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:26,330
值0到最大值255，所以这个像素中有很多红色。
value of 0 to a maximum value of 255, so this pixel has got quite a lot of red in it.

22
00:01:26,330 --> 00:01:29,700
它几乎没有绿色，而且几乎没有蓝色。
It’s got almost no green, and it’s got almost no blue.

23
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,050
让我们转向一朵粉红色的花。
Let’s move over to a pink flower.

24
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:35,730
这有点接近白色，我们看到这个像素有很大的数量
This is a bit closer to white, and we see that this pixel has got a significant amount

25
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,810
红色，相当数量的绿色，和相当数量的蓝色。
of red, and a fair amount of green, and a fair amount of blue.

26
00:01:38,810 --> 00:01:44,210
我们来看看这片绿叶，我们看到绿色值是
Let’s go and have a look on a green leaf here, and we see that the green value is the

27
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:49,080
最大的一个，但那里也有一些红色和蓝色，但以绿色为主。
biggest one, but there is also an amount of red and blue there, but dominated by green.

28
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:52,890
有一些小小的蓝色花朵，所以我要放大这部分
There are some tiny little blue flowers so I’m going to zoom in on this part of the

29
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:59,450
图像，然后点击其中一个蓝色的花朵，正如我们所料，蓝色值占主导地位
image, and click on one of those blue flowers, and as we would expect, the blue value dominates

30
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,450
这里。
here.

31
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:02,750
我们来看看其中一个图像平面。
Let’s have a look at one of these image planes.

32
00:02:02,750 --> 00:02:04,610
我要显示图像。
I am going to display the image.

33
00:02:04,610 --> 00:02:10,190
我将显示所有行和所有列，但仅显示属于平面的那些像素
I’m going to display all rows and all columns, but only those pixels that belong to plane

34
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,440
1号。
number 1.

35
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,629
我们终于得到它了。
And there we have it.

36
00:02:12,629 --> 00:02:15,689
现在这是灰度图像。
This is now a grey scale image.

37
00:02:15,689 --> 00:02:19,620
颜色已全部消失，这是红色平面，第一个平面。
The color has all gone and this is the red plane, the first plane.

38
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:24,480
如果我看一下这里的值，我们会发现它们在红色的地方非常明亮
And if I look at the values here we see that they are quite bright where there was red

39
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:27,709
在图像中，在图像中没有红色的情况下，它们非常暗。
in the image, and they’re very dark where there was no red in the image.

40
00:02:27,709 --> 00:02:32,030
因此绿色的叶子会变黑，蓝色的花朵会变暗。
So it will be dark in the green leaves, it will be dark on the blue flowers.

41
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:36,209
我们可以看看绿色平面，那是2号飞机。
We can look at the green plane, that’s plane number 2.

42
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:38,530
我们可以看到这看起来很不一样。
We can see that this looks quite different.

43
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:44,209
红色的花很暗-这是因为它们没有任何绿色-而是
The red flowers are quite dark—that’s because they don’t have any green in them—whereas

44
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:48,730
叶子看起来比以前更亮一些，粉红色的白色
the leaves are looking a little bit brighter than they were before, and the pinky white

45
00:02:48,730 --> 00:02:52,810
鲜花也看起来相当明亮，因为白色的花朵有混合物
flowers are also looking reasonably bright because the white flowers have got a mixture

46
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:54,439
红色和绿色和蓝色。
of red and green and blue.

47
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:58,709
最后，我们可以看看蓝色平面，那是第三个平面。
Finally, we can look at the blue plane, that’s the third plane.

48
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:02,870
在这里，我们看到底部的小蓝花现在看起来非常明亮。
And here we see that the little blue flowers around the bottom are now looking quite bright.

49
00:03:02,870 --> 00:03:06,190
正如我前面提到的那样，白色的花朵，我前面提到的粉红色的白色花朵，也在寻找
The white flowers as I mentioned, pinky white flowers as I mentioned before, are also looking

50
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:09,099
相当明亮，因为它们含有相当数量的蓝色。
reasonably bright because they contain a fair amount of blue.

51
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:13,019
绿叶也看起来很暗，因为没有太多的蓝色被反射
The green leaves are also looking quite dark because there’s not much blue being reflected

52
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:15,400
从那些叶子。
from those leaves.

53
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,790
我们可以将彩色图像视为包含三个平面。
We can consider a color image then as comprising three planes.

54
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:23,340
我们将它们称为红色，绿色和蓝色平面。
We refer to those as the red, green and blue planes.

55
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:28,349
我们可以认为每个平面都是灰度图像，其中像素值对应于
Each plane we can consider to be a grey scale image, where the pixel value corresponds to

56
00:03:28,349 --> 00:03:33,019
该特定像素位置处的原色数量。
the amount of that primary color at that particular pixel location.

57
00:03:33,019 --> 00:03:37,269
因此，如果我们在这里看到这些白色的花朵，我们会看到它们在红色和绿色中是明亮的
So if we look at these white flowers here, we see that they are bright in the red, green

58
00:03:37,269 --> 00:03:38,269
和蓝色图像。
and blue images.

59
00:03:38,269 --> 00:03:42,920
这意味着那些白色的花朵含有大量的红色，还有很多绿色和许多
That means that those white flowers contain a lot of red, and a lot of green and a lot

60
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,920
蓝色
of blue.

61
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,659
相比之下，红色图像中的红色花朵非常明亮，但它们非常非常
By contrast, the red flowers are quite bright in the red image, but they’re very, very

62
00:03:47,659 --> 00:03:49,900
绿色和蓝色图像中的黑暗。
dark in the green and blue images.

63
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:55,569
所以红色的花朵包含许多红色，正如你所料，绿色不是很多
So the red flowers comprise a lot of red color, as you would expect, not much green and not

64
00:03:55,569 --> 00:03:56,650
很蓝。
much blue.

65
00:03:56,650 --> 00:04:00,701
我们可以看到黄色的花朵在红色和绿色的图像中是明亮的;就是他们
We can see that the yellow flowers are bright in the red and green images; that is, they

66
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:05,400
反射红光和绿光，但它们不反射蓝光。
reflect red light and green light, but they do not reflect blue light.

67
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:11,129
如果我们将彩色图像视为一组平面，红色绿色和蓝色，请想象它们
If we consider our color image as a stack of planes, red green and blue, imagine them

68
00:04:11,129 --> 00:04:13,169
一个堆叠在另一个之上。
stacked up one above the other.

69
00:04:13,169 --> 00:04:17,790
因此，当谈到描述彩色图像中的像素时，我们将描述像素
So when it comes to describe a pixel in a color image now, we describe the pixel at

70
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:22,480
坐标u，v，这就是我们以前做过的事情;你是水平坐标，
the coordinate u,v and this is what we’ve done previously; u is the horizontal coordinate,

71
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,340
v是垂直坐标。
v is the vertical coordinate.

72
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:28,570
现在我们要做的是深入了解这一堆图像。
And now what we’re going to do is drill down through this stack of images.

73
00:04:28,570 --> 00:04:34,090
所以这是红色值，然后我们找到绿色值，然后我们找到蓝色值。
So this is the red value, then we find the green value, and then we find the blue value.

74
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:39,280
所以在坐标u，v处，像素值实际上由三个数字组成。
So at the coordinate u,v the pixel value is actually comprised of three numbers.

75
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,670
它是一个三元素矢量：包含红色，绿色和蓝色成分。
It is a three-element vector: contains a red, green and blue component.

76
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:49,570
我们之前已经看过我们在MATLAB中索引矩阵的方式，在MATLAB中我们
We’ve previously looked at the way we index into a matrix in MATLAB, and in MATLAB we

77
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:52,200
表示具有两个坐标的矩阵。
represent a matrix with two coordinates.

78
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:57,690
第一个坐标是行号，第二个坐标是列号。
The first coordinate is the row number, and the second coordinate is the column number.

79
00:04:57,690 --> 00:05:02,350
在彩色图像中，就MATLAB而言，它是一个三维矩阵，并且
In a color image it’s a three-dimensional matrix as far as MATLAB is concerned, and

80
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:06,130
我们再次使用一堆飞机的类比。
again we use this analogy of a stack of planes.

81
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:11,970
所以，第一个索引是行号，第二个索引是列号和
So again, the first index is the row number, the second index is the column number and

82
00:05:11,970 --> 00:05:14,620
第三个指标就是我们所说的飞机号码。
the third index is what we call the plane number.

83
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:18,700
它是我们所指的堆栈中的哪个工作表。
It’s which sheet in the stack that we are referring to.

84
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,420
正如我在之前的一次演讲中提到的那样谨慎：我们在谈论的时候
And there’s a caution as I’ve mentioned in an earlier lecture: when we are talking

85
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:29,070
关于在MATLAB中索引图像，我们使用行后跟列。
about indexing into an image in MATLAB, we use the row followed by the column.

86
00:05:29,070 --> 00:05:34,420
当我们参考图像时，我们通常是指水平坐标，然后是垂直坐标
When we refer to an image we generally refer to the horizontal coordinate, then the vertical

87
00:05:34,420 --> 00:05:37,580
坐标，它们被转置;他们被交换了。
coordinate, and they are transposed; they are swapped.

88
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:39,870
所以要小心。
So be careful with that.

89
00:05:39,870 --> 00:05:43,460
我们可以这样编程;也就是说，从命令行。
We can do this programmatically; that is, from the command line.

90
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:44,680
所以我们有了自己的形象。
So we have our image.

91
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:51,270
让我们看看坐标100,100处像素的值，我们想看一下
Let’s look at the value of the pixel at coordinate 100,100, and we want to look at

92
00:05:51,270 --> 00:05:53,210
所有的飞机。
all of the planes.

93
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:56,120
我们从MATLAB得到了这个相当奇怪的结果。
We get this rather strange result from MATLAB.

94
00:05:56,120 --> 00:06:00,340
正如我们所料，它已经使用了三个数字：红色，绿色和蓝色，
It has given use three numbers, as we would expect: the amount of red, green and blue,

95
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,870
但是形式相当不方便。
but in a rather inconvenient form.

96
00:06:02,870 --> 00:06:07,870
当我们这样做时，我们实际上必须使用MATLAB运算符，以删除两个
We actually have to use the MATLAB operator squeeze when we do this, to remove two of

97
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,430
MATLAB所指的单身尺寸。
what MATLAB refers to as singleton dimensions.

98
00:06:11,430 --> 00:06:16,870
因此，如果我们现在这样做，我们就有了这个特定像素的矢量值。
So if we do that now we have a vector value for this particular pixel.
