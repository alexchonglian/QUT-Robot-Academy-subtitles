1
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:08,990
我们已经谈到了颜色对人类的重要性，我们有成千上万的颜色
We have talked about how important color is to human beings, that we have thousands of

2
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:12,960
用词来形容许多不同深浅的色彩。
words to describe many, many different shades of color.

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,160
颜色对我们来说显然很重要;它帮助我们在日常生活中能够描述
Color is clearly important to us; it helps us in our everyday life to be able to describe

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,110
物体的颜色。
objects by their color.

5
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:23,120
那么这种颜色概念从何而来？
So where does this concept of color come from?

6
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:28,660
这个过程的许多部分导致你对颜色的感知
There a number of parts of the process that lead to you having a perception of color in

7
00:00:28,660 --> 00:00:33,430
你的思想和我们要做的是从头到尾经历那些。
your mind and what we are going to do is go through those from the beginning to the end.

8
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,581
在整个过程开始时，我们拥有所谓的光源。
At the start of the whole process we have what we call an illuminant.

9
00:00:35,581 --> 00:00:41,310
光源是发光的东西，光线照在场景上，闪耀着光芒
An illuminant is a thing that emits light and the light shines on the scene, shines

10
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,760
在我们感兴趣的对象上，我们称之为入射光，我们称之为
on the object that we are interested in and we call this incoming light, we call that

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:47,320
照度。
the illuminance.

12
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:52,440
所以照度是来自光源的光线落在我们感兴趣的物体上
So the illuminance is the light from the illuminant that falls on the object that we are interested

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,440
在。
in.

14
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,260
现在，物体反射了一些光和来自物体的光
Now the object reflects some of that light and the light that comes from the object we

15
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,900
我们称之为亮度，我们谈论对象的亮度。
refer to as the luminance, we talk about the luminance of the object.

16
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:08,930
在这种情况下，我们将参考苹果的亮度，因此光线来自我们的
In this case we would refer to the luminance of the apple, so light is coming in from our

17
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:15,290
光亮的，撞击苹果，反射它并进入我们观察者的眼睛。
illuminant, striking the apple, reflecting off it and entering the eye of our observer.

18
00:01:15,290 --> 00:01:16,971
一些非常神奇的事情发生在眼睛里面。
Some pretty amazing things happen within the eye.

19
00:01:16,971 --> 00:01:24,670
进入的光子会触发杆的后部和锥形细胞的化学反应
The incoming photons trigger a chemical reaction in the rod and cone cells at the back of your

20
00:01:24,670 --> 00:01:25,730
眼睛。
eye.

21
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:30,830
它们又导致通过视神经传播的电脉冲
They lead, in turn, to electrical impulses which are transmitted through the optic nerve

22
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:35,200
到你大脑的视觉皮层，它位于你的脑后，那个
to the visual cortex of your brain, which is located in the back of your head, and that

23
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,120
导致红色的感知。
leads to the perception of the color red.

24
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:42,000
您将与您正在查看的对象相关联-在这种情况下，苹果。
Which you would associate with the object you are looking at—in this case, the apple.
