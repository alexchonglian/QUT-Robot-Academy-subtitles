1
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:08,780
该过程的下一部分是反射。这就是入射照度反映的地方
The next part of the process is reflectance. That is where the incoming illuminance reflects

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:14,219
一个物体。我们非常熟悉有光泽的表面或镜子反射的能力
off an object. We are very familiar with the ability of shiny surfaces or mirrors to reflect

3
00:00:14,219 --> 00:00:16,810
光。在高中物理学中我们学习了
light. In high school physics we learn about the

4
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:21,840
来自这样一个表面的反射规则，其中入射角等于角度
rules of reflection from such a surface, where the angle of incidence equals the angle of

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:26,840
反射，我们称之为镜面反射。现在这不是说什么
reflection and we refer to this as specular reflection. Now this is not saying anything

6
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:30,730
关于反射过程中发生的颜色变化，它只是谈论了
about the color change that occurs during reflection, it is simply talking about the

7
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:36,250
反射过程的几何形状。我们称之为镜面反射
geometry of the reflection process. We refer to this as specular reflection, which

8
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:41,480
与镜子的拉丁词有关。我们之前见过WilliamHerschel，他是谁
is related to the Latin word for mirror. We met William Herschel before, who is the guy

9
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,579
谁发现了红外辐射，他在望远镜中制造了大镜子
who discovered infra-red radiation and he made the big mirror in his telescope from

10
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:53,600
一种被称为窥器金属的金属-它是铜和锡的反射合金
a type of metal that was called speculum metal — it was a reflective alloy of copper and tin and

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,980
它曾被用于制造望远镜镜子。
it was used in the old days for making telescope mirrors.

12
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:03,790
光被物体反射的更真实的模型就是所谓的朗伯（Lambertian）
A more realistic model for the way light is reflected off objects is what is called Lambertian

13
00:01:03,790 --> 00:01:09,210
反射和朗伯反射与镜面反射的不同之处在于传入
reflection, and Lambertian reflection differs from specular reflection in that the incoming

14
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:14,759
光以各种方向反射。这就是发生的那种反思
light is reflected off in all manner of directions. This is the sort of reflection that occurs

15
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:21,749
从暗淡或无光泽的表面。有时称为漫反射，它以约翰命名
from a dull or matt surface. Sometimes called diffuse reflection and it is named after Johann

16
00:01:21,749 --> 00:01:28,369
兰伯特，他是18世纪的物理学家。被反射的光的强度
Lambert, who was a physicist in the 1700s. The intensity of the light that is reflected

17
00:01:28,369 --> 00:01:34,729
从表面看，它与反射角有关，而Lambertian则有趣
from the surface is related to the angle of reflection, and what is interesting with Lambertian

18
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:40,840
反射是它导致亮度对观察者的角度不变
reflection is that it leads to the brightness being invariant to the observer’s angle

19
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:44,959
观点。现在月亮是兰伯蒂亚的一个很好的例子
of view. Now the moon is a really good example of Lambertian

20
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:50,329
反射。我们知道月球是一个球体，但是当我们看到它时，它似乎是一个球体
reflection. We know that the moon is a sphere, but when we look at it, it appears to be a

21
00:01:50,329 --> 00:01:56,409
除了陨石坑和海洋之外，相当均匀明亮的圆盘。所以它的原因
fairly uniformly bright disk, apart from the craters and the seas. So the reason that it

22
00:01:56,409 --> 00:02:01,889
即使光被反射，看起来也是均匀明亮的，是成比例的
appears is to be uniformly bright even though the light has been reflected, is proportioned

23
00:02:01,889 --> 00:02:07,179
到角度的cos符号，是我们正在看的区域
to the cos sign of the angle, is that the area of the region that we are looking at

24
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:12,760
似乎改变了大小。这是一个夸张的例子：我采用了这个特殊的补丁
appears to change in size. Here is an exaggerated example: I take this particular patch of the

25
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:17,599
月亮和来自那个补丁的大部分光被直接反射，它对应
moon and most of the light from that patch is being reflected directly up, it corresponds

26
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,060
到这样的地方。如果我采取靠近杆子的补丁，很明显
to an area something like this. If I take a patch that is down near the pole it is clearly

27
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:28,870
对我的视野倾向于倾向于。所以它将拥有其中之一
going to be inclined with respect to my field of view. So it is going to have one of these

28
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,980
光线在这里相关联，所以它将反射较少的光，但区域-
rays down here associated, so it is going to be reflecting less light, but the area—the

29
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:39,500
这个补丁的表观面积较小，因为我倾斜地看着它。所以如果我考虑一下
apparent area of this patch—is smaller because I am looking at it obliquely. So if I consider

30
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,250
亮度是发射到其表面区域的光的比率，这是
the brightness to be the ratio of the light being emitted to its surface area, this is

31
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:49,379
对视角不变。所以我们刚看了几何
invariant to the view angle. So we have just looked at the geometry of

32
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:53,500
反射，射线的方向作为一种功能从表面反射
the reflection, the direction of the rays being reflected form the surface as a function

33
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:59,900
入射光线。现在让我们谈谈反射如何改变传入的颜色
of the incoming ray. Let’s talk now about how reflection changes the color of incoming

34
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:05,969
光。在这里我们看到一个红房子砖，这里的情节显示了我们所说的反射率
light. Here we see a red house brick, the plot here shows what we call the reflectance

35
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:10,010
房子砖;也就是说，从砖块反射的光的比例
of the house brick; that is, the fraction of light that is reflected form the brick

36
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:14,920
作为波长的函数。这是一个非常复杂的曲线，我们看到有一些
as a function of wavelength. And it is quite a complex curve, we see that there are some

37
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:19,060
频谱的一部分，它反射大量的光，还有其他
parts of the spectrum where it reflects a large amount of light and there are other

38
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,659
光谱中反射很少光的部分。
parts of the spectrum where it reflects very little light.

39
00:03:22,659 --> 00:03:27,420
右侧图表显示了对频谱可见部分的放大。
The right hand graph shows a zoom into the visible part of the spectrum.

40
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:32,939
现在我们可以看到红砖在该地区反射的蓝光不是很多
Now we can see that the red brick reflects not very much blue light in the region, say

41
00:03:32,939 --> 00:03:38,349
400至500纳米，但它确实反映了相当多的红光正在下降
400 to 500 nanometers, but it does reflect a fair amount of the red light that is falling

42
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:44,200
它表示600至700纳米之间的光，这就是为什么它看起来对我们来说是红色的
down, say the light between 600 and 700 nanometers, and that is why it looks red to us, it reflects

43
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,829
更多的红光然后它反射蓝光。所以这是红砖的光谱，不同
more red light then it reflects blue light. So this is the spectrum of a red brick, different

44
00:03:49,829 --> 00:03:55,799
矿物质具有不同的反射光谱，在这里我们可以看到反射光谱
minerals have different reflectance spectrums and here we see the reflectance spectrum for

45
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,719
一些矿物质。如果我们有一台可以测量数字反射率的仪器
a number of minerals. If we have an instrument that can measure the reflectance at a number

46
00:04:00,719 --> 00:04:05,870
不同波长的仪器，可能像光谱仪或超光谱相机，
of different wavelengths, an instrument perhaps like a spectrometer or a hyper spectral camera,

47
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:09,889
然后我们可以测量这些特定曲线中的一条，我们可以将它与库匹配
then we can measure one of these particular curves and we can match it against a library

48
00:04:09,889 --> 00:04:14,939
已知的矿物质，并用它来识别场景中的矿物质。
of known minerals and use it to identify what minerals are within the scene.

49
00:04:14,939 --> 00:04:20,530
所以回顾一下，入射光，我们称之为照度，它有一个光谱E，
So to recap, incoming light, we refer to as the illuminance and it has got a spectrum E,

50
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:25,410
它具有波长λ的函数，并且我们有反射率
which has got a function of the wavelength lambda, and we have the reflectance of the

51
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:30,890
对象本身，我们称之为R，它也是lambda的函数。
object itself which we refer to as R and it is also a function of lambda.

52
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,870
离开苹果的光线，我们称之为苹果的照度，
So the light that leaves the apple, which we refer to as the illuminance of the apple,

53
00:04:34,870 --> 00:04:41,730
我将使用符号L，它也是波长的函数，现在是L
I am going to use the symbol L and it is also a function of the wavelength, now L at any

54
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:47,350
特定的lambda在相同的lambda乘以R时等于E.
particular lambda is equal to E at that same lambda multiplied by R at that

55
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:52,260
特别是lambda。这就是离开苹果的光谱，即功能
particular lambda. That is the spectrum of the light that is leaving the apple, the function

56
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:57,520
入射光的光谱，以及苹果反射率的作用。
of the spectrum of the incoming light, and the function of the reflectance of the apple.
