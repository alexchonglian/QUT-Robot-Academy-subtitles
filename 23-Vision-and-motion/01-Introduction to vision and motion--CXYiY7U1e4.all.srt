欢迎来到机器人视觉课程的最后一个讲座，感谢您的光临。
Welcome to the last lecture in the Robotic Vision course and thanks for hanging in there.

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,869
我们已经谈了很多关于图像形成方式，我们如何改变三维图像的方法
We've talked a lot about the way that images are formed, how we transform the three-dimensional

3
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:19,219
世界变成了二维图像。所有这一切都有一个潜在的假设
world into a two dimensional image. And an underlying assumption in all of that has been

4
00:00:19,219 --> 00:00:23,200
相机静止不动，物体静止不动。
that the camera is stationary and the object is stationary.

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:27,980
那么现在我们要考虑相机移动的情况。第一件事
Well now we're going to consider the case where the camera is moving. The first thing

6
00:00:27,980 --> 00:00:33,930
我们要看一下当相机在太空中移动时图像是如何变化的。
we're going to look at then is how does the image change as the camera moves through space.

7
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:38,149
然后我们将翻转并说，让我们说我有一些东西的形象
And then we're going to flip it around and say, let's say that I've got an image of something

8
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:43,350
在图像中看起来像这样，我希望它在图像中看起来像这样。我们是什么
that looks like this in the image and I want it to look like this in the image. What we're

9
00:00:43,350 --> 00:00:48,539
试图解决的是相机应该如何移动才能改变图像
going to try to work out is how should the camera move in order to change the image from

10
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:49,859
对此。
this to this.

11
00:00:49,859 --> 00:00:54,830
相机必须改变它的视角，所以我们想直接解决相机的问题
The camera has to change its viewpoint and so we want to work out directly how the camera

12
00:00:54,830 --> 00:00:59,909
应该移动，以实现这一目标。这是一种称为“基于视觉的控制”的技术
should move in order to make that happen. This is a technique called "Vision Based Control"

13
00:00:59,909 --> 00:01:03,900
有时被称为“视觉伺服”，这是我花了很多钱的主题
sometimes called "Visual Servoing" and is a topic that I've spent a good deal of my

14
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:05,180
生活在思考。
life thinking about.
