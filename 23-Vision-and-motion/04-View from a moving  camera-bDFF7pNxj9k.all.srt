1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,960
我这里有一个规则的点网格。我们将看看这些点是如何移动的
What I have here is a regular grid of dots. We are going to look at how those dots move

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,950
在相机移动时在相机的图像平面中。
in the image plane of a camera as the camera moves.

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:16,529
在这里，我们让相机看着那个网格点;我要移动相机
Here we have the camera looking at that grid of dots; and I am going to move the camera

4
00:00:16,529 --> 00:00:20,260
向左-这是负X方向-我们可以说是点
towards the left — that's the negative X direction — and we can say that the dots

5
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:26,090
所有这些都在图像平面中沿正X方向移动。回到中间
all appear to move in the positive X direction in the image plane. Come back to the middle

6
00:00:26,090 --> 00:00:31,140
现在我沿着正Y方向移动相机。我们看到所有的点都出现了
and now I move the camera in the positive Y direction. We see the dots all appear to

7
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:38,149
在框架中向上移动;这是在负Y方向。如果我向下移动相机
move upward in the frame; that's in the negative Y direction. If I move the camera downwards

8
00:00:38,149 --> 00:00:44,140
朝着点的平面，我们看到它们都倾向于向外扩展
towards the plane of the dots, we see that they all tend to be expanding outwards from

9
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:50,620
图像平面的中心。最后，如果我绕Z轴旋转相机-那是什么
the centre of the image plane. And finally, if I rotate the camera around its Z axis — what's

10
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:55,090
称为光轴-我们看到所有点都围绕中心旋转
called the optic axis — we see that the dots all appear to rotate around the centre

11
00:00:55,090 --> 00:00:57,480
图像平面。
of the image plane.

12
00:00:57,480 --> 00:01:02,070
考虑一下我们有一个相机看着一个物体，在这种情况下是一个球。
Consider that we have a camera looking at an object, in this case a ball.

13
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,420
我们以一种我们应该非常熟悉的方式将坐标框架附加到相机上
We attach a coordinate frame to the camera in a way that we should be quite familiar

14
00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:10,220
与现在。我们称之为坐标系C.现在我们可以定义球的位置
with now. We call that coordinate frame C. Now we can define the position of the ball

15
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:16,310
关于坐标框架C.现在我们可以认为相机是可以的
with respect to coordinate frame C. Now we can consider that the camera is able

16
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,970
移动，它在三维空间中移动，所以我们可能有一个速度
to move, and it's moving in three-dimensional space so we can have potentially a velocity

17
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:27,280
在X，Y和Z方向上，它可以绕X，Y和Z轴旋转。
in the X, Y and Z directions, and it can rotate about the X, Y and Z axis.

18
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:32,380
我们可以将球的三维位置投影到图像平面中并获得
We can project the three dimensional position of the ball into the image plane and we obtain

19
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:35,329
坐标u，v。
the coordinate u,v.

20
00:01:35,329 --> 00:01:37,900
让我们在MATLAB中演示一些这些想法。
Let's demonstrate some of these ideas in MATLAB.

21
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:45,390
我们要创建一个相机对象，我们之前遇到过这个。这是针孔
We are going to create a camera object, and we've encountered this before. It's a pinhole

22
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:51,369
具有默认参数的摄像机，这些显示在此处。我要创造一个观点
camera with default parameters, and these are shown here. I am going to create a point

23
00:01:51,369 --> 00:01:56,880
在世界上，它将是一米的X坐标，一米的Y坐标，Z坐标
in the world and it's going to be X coordinate of a metre, Y coordinate of a metre, Z coordinate

24
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:05,340
五米转置，使其成为列向量。现在我可以预测
of five metres. Transpose that so that it is a column vector. Now I can project that

25
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:12,010
三维世界指向我相机的图像平面，它就在这个坐标上
three-dimensional world point onto the image plane of my camera, and it is at this coordinate

26
00:02:12,010 --> 00:02:21,400
-672foru，672forv。现在我要重新指出这一点，
- 672 for u, 672 for v. Now I am going to project the point again,

27
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:26,830
但是这次我要换相机。我可以用'tcam'选项做到这一点-
but this time I am going to shift the camera. I can do that with the ‘tcam’ option — the

28
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:33,989
摄像机的变换-我将在X方向上移动相机0.1米。
transform of the camera — and I am going to move the camera 0.1 metres in the X direction.

29
00:02:33,989 --> 00:02:39,569
所以我们之前遇到的'transl'函数创建了一个齐次变换
So the ‘transl’ function we've encountered before creates a homogeneous transformation

30
00:02:39,569 --> 00:02:45,629
代表翻译。此平移中没有旋转：X方向为0.1，
that represents a translation. There's no rotation in this translation: 0.1 in X direction,

31
00:02:45,629 --> 00:02:50,890
Y方向0米，Z方向0米。
0 metres in the Y direction, 0 metres in the Z direction.

32
00:02:50,890 --> 00:02:53,860
关闭最后一个括号，这就是重点。
Close that last bracket off, and here is the point.

33
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:59,230
我在正X方向上移动了一小部分相机，我们可以看到
I've moved the camera a small amount in the positive X direction, and we can see that

34
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:05,140
你的坐标减少了。该点已在图像中向左移动。
the u coordinate has reduced. The point has moved toward the left in the image.

35
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:11,920
我可以通过获取移位之间的差异来计算此运动的灵敏度
I can compute the sensitivity of this motion by taking the difference between the shifted

36
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,480
点，及其原始位置，除以我移动相机的数量。这个
point, and its original position, and dividing by the amount that I moved the camera. This

37
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:22,239
灵敏度表示对于每个仪表我在正X方向上移动相机，
sensitivity indicates that for every metre that I move the camera in the positive X direction,

38
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,150
投影将在图像平面上移动-160像素。
the projection will move -160 pixels on the image plane.

39
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,330
我们可以为其他类型的相机运动重复此过程。
We can repeat this process for other kinds of camera motion.

40
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:38,260
这是我们对世界点的投射函数，我现在要翻译它
Here is our projection function of the world point, and I am going to now translate the

41
00:03:38,260 --> 00:03:48,450
相机在Z方向。减去原始位置除以0.1，我们在这里看到
camera in the Z direction. Subtract the original position and divide by 0.1, and here we see

42
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:54,230
如果我沿Z方向移动相机1米，这个特定的点会移动
that if I move the camera 1 metre in the Z direction, this particular point will move

43
00:03:54,230 --> 00:04:01,680
u方向为32像素，v方向为32像素。我可以替换那个翻译
32 pixels in the u direction, 32 pixels in the v direction. I can replace that translation

44
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:09,500
旋转。让我们旋转相机，比如围绕X轴的0.1弧度，然后重复，
with a rotation. Let's rotate the camera, say 0.1 radians around the X axis and repeat,

45
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:13,700
在这种特殊情况下，点的投影将移动40像素
and in this particular case the projection of the point will move by 40 something pixels

46
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:20,579
在u方向和850像素-在v方向上的大量运动。
in the u direction and 850 pixels — a significant amount of motion in the v direction.

47
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:25,970
我们看到的是我如何移动相机和投影方式之间的关系
What we've seen is the relationship between how I move the camera and how the projection

48
00:04:25,970 --> 00:04:27,600
在图像平面上有所不同。
varies on the image plane.

49
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:33,380
可视化这里发生的事情的更直观的方法是显示流场，和
A more intuitive way to visualise what's going on here is to display the flow field, and

50
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:38,110
为这个特定的摄像机定义了流场，我传递了速度
the flow field is defined for this particular camera and I pass in the velocity of the

51
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:42,120
相机。所以在这种情况下，我将传递相机的空间速度，所以
camera. So in this case I am going to pass in the spatial velocity of the camera, so

52
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:49,240
这是一个六向量，它在X方向上有单位速度。流场看起来像
that's a six vector and it has got unit velocity in the X direction. The flow field looks like

53
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,490
这个。它说如果摄像机正向X方向移动，那么每个点都是如此
this. It's saying that if the camera is moving in the positive X direction, then every point

54
00:04:54,490 --> 00:05:01,810
在图像中将向左移动。如果我将相机速度更改为单位
in the image will be shifted towards the left. If I change the camera velocity to be unit

55
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:05,860
在Y方向上的速度，然后流场看起来像这样。如果我的相机在移动
velocity in the Y direction, then the flow field looks like this. If my camera is moving

56
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,930
在正Y方向，这是我定义我的相机坐标框架的方式-
in the positive Y direction, which is the way I defined my camera coordinate frame — the

57
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:15,440
相机在世界上向下移动-然后图像中的每个点都向上移动。
camera is moving downwards in the world — then every point in the image appears to move upwards.

58
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:20,479
现在让我们将速度改为Z方向的单位速度。想象一下相机
Now let's change the velocity to being unit velocity in the Z direction. Imagine the camera

59
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:25,850
正在走向现场。现在，流场看起来像这样。我们有这个非常独特的
is moving towards the scene. Now the flow field looks like this. We have this very distinctive

60
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:29,340
来自图像平面中心的辐射图案。
radiating pattern coming from the centre of the image plane.

61
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:34,340
我要向你展示的最后一个例子是零平移运动而且它有
The final example that I want to show you has got zero translational motion and it has

62
00:05:34,340 --> 00:05:40,380
获得围绕Z轴的单位旋转运动。我正在旋转相机，在这种情况下，
got unit rotational motion around the Z axis. I'm rotating the camera and in this case,

63
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:46,180
场景中的每个点似乎都围绕图像平面的中心旋转。
every point in the scene appears to rotate around the centre of the image plane.

64
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:51,280
让我们考虑一下我们有一个常规的点阵列，而摄像机正在移动
Let's consider that we have a regular array of points and the camera is moving in the

65
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:56,750
正X方向。它有一个正X速度分量。我们观察到的是
positive X direction. It's got a positive X velocity component. What we observe is that

66
00:05:56,750 --> 00:06:01,039
图像中的所有点均匀向左移动。现在让我们考虑更多
all the points in the image move uniformly toward the left. Now let's consider a more

67
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,039
有趣的例子，相机向前移动。现在我们看到的是这个有趣的
interesting example where the camera is moving forward. And now what we see is this interesting

68
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:11,520
辐射效果，有点像星际迷航的翘曲速度效果。我们看到了这一点
radiating effect, a bit like the Star Trek warp speed effect. We see that points towards

69
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,419
图像的边缘比图像中间的点移动得更快。中心
the edge of the image are moving faster than points in the middle of the image. The centre

70
00:06:16,419 --> 00:06:21,910
我们称之为扩张的焦点。这是所有像素的点
of the image we call the focus of expansion. It's the point from which all of the pixels

71
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:28,080
似乎是放射出来的。现在考虑我们将相机向正方向旋转
appear to be radiating from. Consider now that we rotate the camera in a positive direction

72
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,150
围绕Z轴。如果我拿着相机，这将对应我旋转相机
around the Z axis. If I’m holding the camera, that will correspond to me rotating the camera

73
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:38,470
顺时针方向。像素速度的模式现在非常不同。我们看
in a clockwise direction. The pattern of pixel velocities is now quite different. We see

74
00:06:38,470 --> 00:06:44,580
每个像素的速度与以图像中间为中心的圆相切。
that each pixel's velocity is tangential to a circle centred on the middle of the image.

75
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:48,509
到目前为止，我们已经考虑过一个相当人为的例子。我们想象这台相机正在移动
So far, we've considered a fairly contrived example. We've imagined this camera moving

76
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:53,949
朝着一个统一的点阵。现实世界不是那样，但我们可以计算
towards a uniform array of dots. The real world is not like that, but we can compute

77
00:06:53,949 --> 00:06:59,190
这种光流现象用于真实图像序列。在这里，我们看到一些图像
this optical flow phenomena for real image sequences. Here we see some imagery which

78
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:04,380
从无人驾驶飞行器捕获，如果你愿意，可以使用飞行机器人。机器人在飞
is captured from an unmanned aerial vehicle, a flying robot if you like. The robot is flying

79
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:10,199
在非常恒定的高度，并在非常直线上移动。每一个
at pretty much constant altitude, and moving in very much a straight line. Each of these

80
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:16,419
绿色箭头表示图像中的一个点从一帧移动的方向
green arrows indicates the direction that a point in the image is moving from one frame

81
00:07:16,419 --> 00:07:21,319
到下一个。这种像素运动在帧与帧之间被夸大了。一点是
to the next. This pixel motion has been greatly exaggerated from frame to frame. A point is

82
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:26,090
只会移动几个像素。虽然平均像素速度在内部向下
only going to move a few pixels. Although the average pixel velocity is downwards within

83
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:30,780
在图像中，我们还可以看到有一些左右运动，这表明
the image, we can also see that there is some side to side motion, and this would indicate

84
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:35,419
然后，机器人并没有完全沿着直线路径飞行-也许正在受到冲击
then that the robot is not exactly flying a straight-line path - perhaps is being buffeted

85
00:07:35,419 --> 00:07:39,349
通过阵风导致其航向角稍微改变。
by wind gusts which is causing its heading angle to change a little bit.

86
00:07:39,349 --> 00:07:45,759
另一个例子是这个更具三维性的例子，是从一辆汽车上的摄像头拍摄的
Another example, this one which is more three-dimensional, is taken from a camera on a car moving along

87
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,500
一条路，旁边有很多停放的汽车，有很多树木。
a road, and there are a lot of parked cars at the side and there are a lot of trees.

88
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,500
在这种特殊情况下你会注意到的是远处的物体相对而言
What you'll notice in this particular case is that objects that are far away cause relatively

89
00:07:54,500 --> 00:08:00,009
光流很小，靠近的物体会产生大量的光流，
little optical flow, where objects that are close by cause a large amount of optical flow,

90
00:08:00,009 --> 00:08:02,669
而靠近的物体会产生大量的光流。我们可以看到这一点
whereas objects that are close by cause a large amount of optical flow. We can see this

91
00:08:02,669 --> 00:08:08,479
再次辐射光流模式。我们可以看到向量都显示出辐射
radiating optical flow pattern again. We can see that the vectors all appear to radiate

92
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,669
从汽车前面的一点，我们称之为扩张的焦点。这才是重点
from a point in front of the car, which we call the focus of expansion. That's the point

93
00:08:13,669 --> 00:08:18,680
在汽车正朝着这个世界的方向发展。我们偶尔会注意到的另一件事
in the world that the car is heading towards. Another thing we will notice occasionally

94
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:24,470
是光流向量疯狂地上下跳动，这是因为汽车
is that the optical flow vectors bounce up and down crazily, and that's because the car

95
00:08:24,470 --> 00:08:29,370
正在开车超速。所以汽车正在向上倾斜，然后向下倾斜。那
was driving over a speed bump. So the car is pitching up and then pitching down. That

96
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:35,269
引起附加的运动分量，其叠加在光流的顶部
causes an additional motion component, which is superimposed on top of the optical flow

97
00:08:35,269 --> 00:08:37,839
由于纯粹的前进动作。
due to just pure forward motion.

98
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,060
这是一种非常强大的错觉。我在旋转的鼓内，我的眼睛可以检测到
This is a very very powerful illusion. I am inside a rotating drum and my eye can detect

99
00:08:56,070 --> 00:09:02,380
鼓的动作。我的眼睛和大脑正在计算我们所谓的光流，并且
the motion of this drum. My eye and my brain are computing what we call optical flow, and

100
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:07,230
由旋转鼓引起的这种光流是与那种光流相同的
this optical flow that's caused by that rotating drum, is the same sort of optical flow that

101
00:09:07,230 --> 00:09:13,680
如果我以这种方式转动头部，或者我以这种方式旋转头部，我就会得到。而这种特殊的错觉
I get if I rotate my head this way, or I rotate my head that way. And this particular illusion

102
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,070
让我觉得有点不安，因为我用眼睛得到的信息-
causes me to feel a little bit uneasy because the information that I get with my eyes — the

103
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:23,870
光流-告诉我，我的头部正在从一侧移动到另一侧但是陀螺仪
optical flow — tells me that my head is moving from side to side but the gyroscopic

104
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:28,170
在我耳边的传感器告诉我，那不会发生。所以两者之间存在脱节
sensors in my ears tell me that that's not happening. So there is a disconnect between

105
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:34,279
我的耳朵告诉我我的态度，以及我的眼睛讲述我的动作，
what my ears are telling me about my attitude, and what my eyes are telling about my motion,

106
00:09:34,279 --> 00:09:40,610
这导致了晕船或轻微恶心的感觉，这就是我挂的原因
and that leads to the sensation of sea sickness or slight nausea, which is why I am hanging

107
00:09:40,610 --> 00:09:42,500
紧紧地对着这些铁轨。
on very tightly to these rails.
