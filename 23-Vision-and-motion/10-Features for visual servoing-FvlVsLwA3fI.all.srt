1
00:00:03,409 --> 00:00:08,389
这些基于图像的视觉控制策略有两个重要的要求。
These image based visual control strategies have got two important requirements.

2
00:00:08,389 --> 00:00:13,780
一种是可靠地找到目标对象上的点，并且可靠地表示每一个点
One is to reliably find the points on the target object, and by reliably means every

3
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:18,440
单帧：当物体移动或相机移动时，我们需要能够识别
single frame: as the object is moving or the camera is moving, we need to be able to identify

4
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:21,010
目标对象上的相同点。
the same points on the target object.

5
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:26,570
第二个问题是确定哪个点是哪个。这就是我们所说的通信
The second problem is to determine which point is which. This is what we call the correspondence

6
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:31,939
问题。因此，在我们之前的三角形目标的情况下，我们需要确定哪个
problem. So, in the case of our triangular target before, we need to determine which

7
00:00:31,939 --> 00:00:37,070
当前视图中的点对应于所需视图中的哪个点。
point in the current view corresponds to which point in the desired view.

8
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:42,110
现在考虑第一个问题：我们如何可靠地找到目标对象上的点。
Considering now the first problem: how do we reliably find points on the target object.

9
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:46,399
曾几何时，这是通过创造非常高的人造场景来完成的
Once upon a time this was done by creating artificial scenes that have got very high

10
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,890
形成鲜明对比。所以这是我在20世纪90年代的博士研究中的两个例子，以及我的观点
contrasts. So here are two examples from my PhD research back in the 1990s, and what I

11
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:57,399
曾经是一个黑色的背景和一个白色的物体。所以我们可以使用非常简单
had was very much a black background and a white object. So we could use very simple

12
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:01,390
阈值技术和二进制视觉处理技术非常非常
thresholding techniques and binary vision processing techniques, which were very very

13
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:07,909
快，以便识别对象。但这显然是非常不现实的。
fast, in order to identify the object. But this is, clearly, very unrealistic.

14
00:01:07,909 --> 00:01:11,080
另一种方法是在具有独特性的场景中引入一些东西
Another approach is to introduce something into the scene which has got a distinctive

15
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:16,030
颜色。我们之前已经谈过这个移动机器人如何相对于导航
color. We have talked before about how this mobile robot could navigate with respect to

16
00:01:16,030 --> 00:01:22,110
橙色交通锥。右侧的图像显示了我们的室内飞行着陆目标
an orange traffic cone. The image on the right shows our landing target for an indoor flying

17
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,670
机器人。它可以看到这四个黄色目标的配置，识别质心
robot. It could see this configuration of four yellow targets, identify the centroid

18
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:28,790
那些，并落在他们身上。
of those, and land on them.

19
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:33,350
我们能够轻松解决问题的另一种方法是使目标变得非常明亮;
Another way we can make the problem easy is to make the target something that's very bright;

20
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:38,829
实际发光的东西。所以也许我们可以在物体上放置彩色LED
something that actually emits light. So perhaps we could put a colored LED on the object in

21
00:01:38,829 --> 00:01:43,899
现场，机器人的视觉系统可以识别非常明亮的特定斑块
the scene, and the robot's vision system can identify that particular patch of very bright

22
00:01:43,899 --> 00:01:48,030
颜色。通过使用明亮的颜色，它更容易分割。
color. By using the bright color it makes it easier to segment.

23
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:52,970
另一种方法是在对象上放置某种模式，这里我们看到了一些
Another approach is to put some kind of pattern on the object, and here we see a number of

24
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:58,210
用于本地化的模式。在中间我们有我们称之为自我相似的东西
patterns that are used for localisation. In the middle we have what we call a self-similar

25
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:04,020
具有里程碑意义，你可以看到计算机视觉算法能够非常非常强大
landmark, and you can see that the computer vision algorithm is able to very, very robustly

26
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,590
确定这三个地标中心的位置，几乎与此无关
determine the position of the centres of those three landmarks, almost irrespective of the

27
00:02:09,590 --> 00:02:16,980
即使目标有些模糊，也可以使用工作表的姿势。在左边我们看到一些
pose of the sheet, even if the targets are somewhat obscured. On the left we see some

28
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:23,170
相关的地标，这次使用的是垂直线而不是圆形
related landmarks, this time using vertical lines rather than circles, which are used

29
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:29,150
在那个特定的机器人中，识别坩埚到机器人的位置，以便它可以捡起它。
in that particular robot to identify the location of the crucible to the robot so it can pick it up.

30
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:34,910
我们也可以使用右侧所示的QR码。我们可以计算QR码的质心，
We can also use QR code as shown here on the right. We can compute centroid of the QR code,

31
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:41,019
它是一种非常独特的模式，但QR码还包含许多字节的信息。
it’s a very unique pattern, but the QR code also contains a number of bytes of information.

32
00:02:41,019 --> 00:02:46,209
通常这些用于在广告中编码URL。所以这个QR码有一个
Often times these are used to encode URLs in advertising. So this QR code has got a

33
00:02:46,209 --> 00:02:50,920
位置，但它也有一些与之相关的信息。
position but it's also got some information associated with it.

34
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:56,849
与QR码相关的是另一种称为AR代码或增强现实的代码
Related to QR codes is another type of code called an AR code or an augmented reality

35
00:02:56,849 --> 00:03:01,780
代码，它们可用于标记三维世界中的对象。
code, and they can be used to label objects in a three-dimensional world.
