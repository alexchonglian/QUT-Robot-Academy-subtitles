1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,260
让我们再次考虑我们有一个相机看着一个物体的情况。再来一次
Let's consider again the situation where we have a camera looking at an object. Once again

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:13,719
这是一个球。我们将坐标C附加到相机，我们的坐标为
it's a ball. We attach a coordinate C to the camera and we have the coordinate of

3
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:17,830
球相对于相机坐标系表示。
the ball expressed with respect to the camera coordinate frame.

4
00:00:17,830 --> 00:00:21,920
我们将介绍一个新的符号，即F帽，它是a的焦距
We're going to introduce a new symbol, which is F hat, and it is the focal length of a

5
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:27,320
透镜，以米为单位，除以由像素给出的像素的尺寸
lens, which is in units of meters, divided by the dimensions of the pixel given by the

6
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:34,550
希腊字母Rho。现在Rho具有每像素米的单位，因此该比率具有像素单位。
Greek letter Rho. Now Rho has units of meters per pixel, so the ratio has got units of pixels.

7
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:40,059
然后，F帽是表示镜头焦距而不是表达的另一种方式
F hat then is another way of representing the focal length of a lens instead of expressing

8
00:00:40,059 --> 00:00:45,899
以米为单位，我们以像素为单位表示，这对我们来说非常有用。
it in units of meters, we express it in units of pixels and this can be very useful to us shortly.

9
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,280
我们可以将球的位置投影到图像平面中，我们将其表示为
We can project the position of the ball into the image plane, and we represent that by

10
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,250
坐标U，V，任何一个都没有新的东西。我要简化表示法
coordinate U, V, there is nothing new in any of this. I'm going to simplify the notation

11
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,800
并将三维空间中球的位置称为大写字母X，大写字母Y，大写字母Z和
and refer to the position of the ball in 3D space as capital X, capital Y, capital Z and

12
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,590
现在我们可以用这种方式在图像平面上写出球投影的坐标，
now we can write the coordinates of the projection of the ball in the image plane in this fashion,

13
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:13,680
使用符号X，Y和Z以及Fhat，记住是镜头表达的焦距
using the symbols X, Y and Z and F hat, which remember is the focal length of the lens expressed

14
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,960
以像素为单位。
in units of pixels.

15
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,729
现在让我们考虑相机正在移动。我们要把它绑在一只兔子身上。相机
Now let's consider that the camera is moving. We're going to strap it to a rabbit. The camera

16
00:01:20,729 --> 00:01:26,840
现在能够以速度移动，我们可以通过三个向量Vx，Vy和
now is able to move with a velocity, which we can express by a three vector Vx, Vy and

17
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:33,450
Vz，它也能够旋转。我们可以表达它的旋转速度，因为它是有角度的
Vz and it's also able to rotate. And we can express its rotational velocity, as it's angular

18
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:38,640
组分OmegaX，OmegaY和OmegaZ的速度。
velocity with components Omega X, Omega Y and Omega Z.

19
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:44,770
那么现在发生了什么？那么我们现在需要考虑球的投射
Well what happens now? Well we now need to think about the projection of the ball in

20
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:50,630
图像平面不仅具有位置U，V，而且还具有图像中的速度
the image plane having not just a location U, V but it's also got a velocity in the image

21
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:54,310
平面，我们用U点和V点代表。
plane, which we'll represent by U dot and V dot.

22
00:01:54,310 --> 00:02:00,100
现在有一个非常着名的表达方式，它将摄像机的速度与摄像机的速度联系起来
Now there's a very well known expression that relates the velocity of the camera to the

23
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:06,030
像平面中的像素速度和这两个量通过雅可比矩阵相关联
pixel velocity in the image plane and these two quantities are related by a Jacobian matrix

24
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,440
我们之前在机器人MOOC中遇到过JacobianMatrices。
and we have come across Jacobian Matrices before in the robotics MOOC.

25
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,440
这里的雅可比矩阵是一个二乘六矩阵，它与摄像机速度和此相关
The Jacobian matrix here is a two by six matrix, which relates the camera velocity and this

26
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,010
是相机的空间速度，它具有平移分量和旋转
is the cameras spatial velocity which has got a translational component and a rotational

27
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:27,739
零件。乘以这个二乘六矩阵，给出我们在图像平面上的速度。
component. Multiplied by this two by six matrix, to give us the velocity in the image plane.

28
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:31,480
图像中该点似乎移动的速度。
The velocity at which that point in the image appears to move.

29
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:36,680
这是我们的MATLAB工作区，我们已经创建了一个相机对象。我要去计算
Here's our MATLAB workspace and we have already created a camera object. I'm going to compute

30
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:42,650
将雅可比图像放入工作空间变量J并且这样做我将使用visjac_p
the image Jacobian into the workspace variable J and to do that I am going to use the visjac_p

31
00:02:42,650 --> 00:02:48,620
方法，这是一个点特征的视觉雅可比的简称，它是相机的一种方法
method, that's short for visual Jacobian for a point feature, it's a method of the camera

32
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:53,129
对象，我将传递我感兴趣的图像平面点的坐标
object and I'm going to pass in the coordinate of the image plane point that I'm interested

33
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:59,010
in和那是600,600，它必须是列向量，所以我在那里放了一个撇号
in and that's at 600, 600, its got to be column vector, so I put an apostrophe there and

34
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:03,470
它对应于距离相机5米的世界点。
it corresponds to a world point that's five meters away from the camera.

35
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:10,190
所以这是视觉雅各布的;它是一个2乘6的矩阵。如果我乘以雅可比图像
So here's the visual Jacobian; it is a 2 by 6 matrix. If I multiply the image Jacobian

36
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:16,300
通过空间速度矢量，让我们考虑X方向的单位速度，没有速度
by a spatial velocity vector, let's consider a unit velocity in the X direction, no velocity

37
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:22,370
在Y或Z并且没有旋转并且它是列向量，那么图像平面点将继续
in Y or Z and no rotation and it's a column vector, then the image plane point is going

38
00:03:22,370 --> 00:03:28,250
在负U方向以每秒160像素的速度移动，它不会移动
to move at 160 pixels per second in the negative U direction and it's not going to move at

39
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,060
一切都在V方向。
all in the V direction.

40
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:37,420
让我们尝试不同的空间速度。让我们来看看如果它在世界上移动会发生什么
Let's try a different spatial velocity. Let's look at what happens if it moves in the world

41
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:45,160
Y方向，我们看到它在图像平面上以负V方向以每秒160个像素移动。
Y direction, we see that it moves at 160 pixels per second in the negative V direction on the image plane.

42
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:50,799
让我们再看一个例子，我们将以单位速度移动摄像机
Let's just look at one more example and we will move the camera at unit velocity in the

43
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:56,530
Z方向;沿着光轴，我们看到现在的图像平面点
Z direction; that's along the optical axis and we see that now the image plane point

44
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:04,650
在U方向上以每秒17.6像素的速度移动，在V方向上以每秒17.6像素的速度移动。
is moving at 17.6 pixels per second in the U direction and 17.6 pixels per second in the V direction.
