1
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:08,519
回顾一下，我们有一个摄像头，它正在观察三维空间中的物体。我们可以
Just to recap we have a camera, which is observing an object in three-dimensional space. We can

2
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,160
将3D空间中对象的位置投影到具有坐标的图像平面中
project the position of the object in 3D space into the image plane where it has a coordinate

3
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:19,910
U，V。假设相机能够移动并且具有平移速度和旋转
U, V. Assume that the camera is able to move and it has translational velocity and rotational

4
00:00:19,910 --> 00:00:24,340
速度。图像平面上的点的速度与相机空间有关
velocity. The velocity of the point on the image plane is related to the camera spatial

5
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:27,710
速度由图像雅可比。
velocity by the image Jacobian.

6
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:33,210
我们可以非常简单地证明这一原则。如果我把头移到右边那么机器人
We can demonstrate this principle very simply. If I move my head to the right then the robot

7
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:39,390
世界上的其他一切似乎都向左移动了。相反，我转动我的头
and everything else in the world appears to move to the left. If instead I rotate my head

8
00:00:39,390 --> 00:00:44,059
在右边，那么世界上的一切也往往向左移动。
towards the right then everything in the world also tends to move to the left.

9
00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:49,579
移动我的脑袋之间有一种模棱两可的态度;纯粹的翻译到右边和
So there's an ambiguity between moving my head; pure translation to the right and the

10
00:00:49,579 --> 00:00:54,590
把头转到右边。视觉外观有点类似。
rotation of my head to the right. The visual appearance is somewhat similar.

11
00:00:54,590 --> 00:01:01,660
我们需要注意两个重要的概念。第一个问题是明显的。
There are two important concepts that we need to be aware of. The first issue is perceptibly.

12
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:05,979
通常，当相机移动时，图像平面上的点也会移动。
In general as the camera moves, points on the image plane move as well.

13
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:10,619
因此在某些情况下，相机会在图像平面中移动一些点
So there are some cases where with the camera moving some points in the image plane will

14
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:16,570
似乎没动。在那种情况下，我们说运动是不可察觉的。看着这个形象
not appear to move. In that case we say the motion is imperceptible. Looking at the image

15
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:20,350
我们无法判断相机是否在移动。
we are not able to tell whether the camera is moving or not.

16
00:01:20,350 --> 00:01:26,860
另一个重要的问题是我们所谓的歧义，有时是完全不同的相机
Another important issue is what we call ambiguity and that is at sometimes quite different camera

17
00:01:26,860 --> 00:01:31,950
速度会导致图像发生相同的变化。我们将举一些具体的例子
velocities cause the same change in the image. And we will give some concrete examples of

18
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:37,240
这两种影响很快就会出现。考虑相机正向移动的情况
both of these effects shortly. Consider the case where the camera is moving in the positive

19
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,159
Z方向我们先前介绍了这种光流辐射模式。
Z direction we have this radiating pattern of optical flow that we introduced earlier.

20
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,159
让我们考虑在图像平面的中间有一个图像平面点。我们
Let's consider we have an image plane point right in the middle of the image plane. We

21
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:52,470
可以看出，当我们离开中心时，光流向量会变大。在
can see that the optical flow vectors get larger as we move away from the centre. In

22
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:57,570
事实上在正中心没有明显的速度。但是，如果我直接前往
fact at the very centre there is no apparent velocity. But, if I am heading directly towards

23
00:01:57,570 --> 00:02:02,930
一个物体，它似乎没有向侧面或向上或向下移动;它停留了
an object it doesn't appear to be moving to the side or upwards or downwards; it's stays

24
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:04,259
到底在哪里。
exactly where it is.

25
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:08,970
如果我继续沿正Z方向移动，这就是我要击中的东西。
This is the thing that I am going to hit if I keep moving in the positive Z direction.

26
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:13,010
所以如果我只看一下图像平面中间的一个点;这是不可能的
So if I just look at a point in the middle of the image plane; it's not possible for

27
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:16,129
我要确定我是否正在前进。
me to determine whether I am moving forwards or not.

28
00:02:16,129 --> 00:02:21,129
不可察觉的运动的另一个例子是相机旋转的情况
Another example of imperceptible motion is the case where the camera is rotating around

29
00:02:21,129 --> 00:02:26,760
它的光轴。因此，如果我考虑图像平面中的一个点，则没有明显的
its optical axis. So again if I consider a point in the image plane there is no apparent

30
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,319
相机旋转时在此特定点的速度。
velocity at this particular point with the camera rotating.

31
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,150
显然，如果我考虑朝向图像边缘的点，则存在显着的速度
Clearly if I consider a point toward the edge of the image there is a significant velocity

32
00:02:34,150 --> 00:02:38,550
由于相机旋转而产生的分量。但是，在图像的中心没有和
component due to the camera rotation. But, in the centre of the image there is none and

33
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:44,650
我看不出我的相机是否围绕光轴旋转，我无法分辨。
I cannot tell by looking at a point there whether my camera is rotating around the optical axis or not.

34
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,780
让我们计算一下雅可比视觉效果，但这次我们将关注这一点
Let's compute the visual Jacobian but, this time we are going to do it about the point

35
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:57,319
它位于图像的中心。那是在坐标512,512处，这是主要的点。
which is in the centre of the image. And that is at coordinate 512, 512 that is the principal point.

36
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:01,430
那是光轴穿透图像平面的地方，我们可以在这里看到它
That's where the optical axis pierces the image plane and we can see that up here in

37
00:03:01,430 --> 00:03:03,920
摄像机对象的参数。
the parameters of the camera object.

38
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,390
我们将在这个特定点计算视觉雅可比，现在让我们来看看
We will compute the visual Jacobian at this particular point, now let's take a look at

39
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:15,970
当我们移动相机并再次以“X”方向运动时会发生什么。我们
what happens when we move the camera and start again with motion in the "X" direction. We

40
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:24,400
转置它，我们再次看到这个点在负“U”方向以每秒160像素的速度移动。
transpose that and we see again that this point moves at 160 pixels per second in the negative "U" direction.

41
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:30,390
现在让我们看看如果我们向“Z”方向移动会发生什么，我们现在看到这个特别的
Now let's see what happens if we move in the "Z" direction and we see now that this particular

42
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:32,489
点将具有零速度。
point is going to have a zero velocity.

43
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:37,250
所以我的相机以每秒一米的速度向前移动，直到那一点，
So my camera is moving forward at a meter per second and as far as that particular point,

44
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:42,400
它的投影图像平面;它根本不动。同样的事情发生在
its projection image plane; it's not moving at all. And the same thing happens in the

45
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:51,470
围绕光轴旋转的情况。我们再次看到，这一点已经得到了解决
case of rotation around the optical axis. We see again, this particular point has got

46
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:53,720
图像平面上的零运动。
zero motion on the image plane.

47
00:03:53,720 --> 00:04:00,909
运动模糊是一件有趣的事情。如果我们看光流场是由于
Motion ambiguity is an interesting thing. If we look at the optical flow field due to

48
00:04:00,909 --> 00:04:05,720
在“X”方向上的正速度;我们看到所有的光流向量
positive velocity in the "X' direction; we see that all that all the optical flow vectors

49
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,260
指向左边。
point towards the left.

50
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:12,599
如果我要围绕“Y”轴以正方向旋转相机，我们就可以获得流量
If I were to rotate the camera in a positive direction around the "Y" axis we get the flow

51
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:16,900
右侧显示的字段。我们可以看到它们看起来很相似。他们是
field shown here on the right. And we can see that they look quite similar. They are

52
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:21,930
当然在图像的中间行非常相似，但我们可以看到顶部和
certainly very similar in the middle rows of the image, but we can see at the top and

53
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:27,610
在图像的底部，对于相机旋转情况，出现光流向量
the bottom of the image that for the camera rotation case the optical flow vectors appear

54
00:04:27,610 --> 00:04:35,470
为了略微弯曲，它们并非全部平行，因为它们是在“X”方向上的纯速度的情况。
to be slightly curved, they are not all parallel as they are in the case of pure velocity in the "X" direction.

55
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:40,979
翻译和轮换之间存在某种模糊性。如果我翻译相机或
There is some sort of ambiguity between translation and rotation. If I translate the camera or

56
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:46,000
我旋转相机，我们得到一些类似的光流场。让我们来探讨一下
I rotate the camera we get somewhat similar optical flow fields. Let's explore this in

57
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,610
一点点细节。
a little bit more detail.

58
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:52,880
在左侧，我们看到由于纯粹的相机转换导致的光流。在右边
On the left we see the optical flow due to pure camera translation. On the right hand

59
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:58,320
我们有相机围绕“Y”轴旋转的情况。上图显示了
side we have the case for the camera rotating around the "Y" axis. The top graph shows the

60
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,970
相机配有焦距较大的镜头时的情况。这对应于长焦
case when the camera has a lens with a large focal length. This corresponds to a telephoto

61
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:09,130
或变焦镜头。在这种情况下，我们看到光流模式非常非常相似
or a zoom lens. And we see in this case that the optical flow patterns are very, very similar

62
00:05:09,130 --> 00:05:14,699
确实。但是，如果我们使用的焦距小的镜头对应于宽视场
indeed. However, if we use a lens with a small focal length that corresponds to a wide field

63
00:05:14,699 --> 00:05:20,169
我们看到光流模式现在与模式非常非常不同
of view we see that the optical flow pattern now is very, very different to the pattern

64
00:05:20,169 --> 00:05:26,400
由于纯粹的“X”翻译。这种模糊性实际上取决于焦距
due to pure "X" translation. This ambiguity in fact depends on the focal length of the

65
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,520
镜片。我们可以通过查看雅可比矩阵图像结构的一些细节来解释这一点。
lens. We can explain this by looking in some detail at the structure of the image Jacobian matrix.

66
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:37,889
考虑相机在“X”方向上具有平移速度的情况。然后那个速度
Consider the case where the camera has translation velocity in the "X" direction. Then that velocity

67
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:44,840
乘以雅可比图像的这一列。旋转周围会发生模棱两可的情况
multiplies this column of the image Jacobian. The ambiguous case occurs with rotation around

68
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:50,229
“Y”轴和欧米茄“Y”乘以雅各比矩阵的这一列。
the "Y" axis and omega "Y" multiplies this column of Jacobian matrix.

69
00:05:50,229 --> 00:05:55,380
对于“F”非常大，焦距长的情况;那么这两个词就变成了
For the case where "F" is very large, a long the focal length; then these two terms become

70
00:05:55,380 --> 00:05:59,960
非常相似。那么在这种情况下会发生什么，因为“F”非常大，它在“U”中占主导地位
quite similar. So what happens in this case because "F" is very large it dominates "U'

71
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:06,500
平方。所以结果实际上是一个常数。它不再是“U”的功能，而是相同的
squared. So the result is effectively a constant. It's no longer a function of "U" and the same

72
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,910
对于第一列，相应的术语不是“U”的函数。所以这两个
for the first column the corresponding term it is not a function of "U". So these two

73
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,759
术语成为类似的功能。
terms become similar functions.

74
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:18,650
如果我们看第二行，我们可以看到它有“F”，变得非常大，它就在
If we look at the second row we can see that it has "F", becomes very large and it is in

75
00:06:18,650 --> 00:06:24,160
分母。该术语将接近零，并再次变得非常相似
the denominator. This term will approach zero and again becomes very similar to the corresponding

76
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,090
图像雅可比矩阵的第一列中的元素。
elements in the first column of the image Jacobian matrix.

77
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:33,050
我们可以采用直观的方法解决这个问题。在这里，我们有一个非常广泛的领域
We can take an intuitive approach to this problem. Here we have a very wide field of

78
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:37,919
查看通过一个非常小的焦距镜头对应的大教堂的图像。和
view image of a cathedral that corresponds through a very small focal length lens. And

79
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:43,750
在这里，我们看到同一个大教堂的狭窄视野图像，并且对应于一个大的
here we see a narrow field of view image of same cathedral and that corresponds to a large

80
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,600
焦距镜头;如果您愿意，可以使用大变焦镜头，长焦镜头。
focal length lens; a big zoom lens, a telephoto lens if you'd like.

81
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:55,780
现在，大焦距镜头对应于这个广阔领域的中心部分
Now that large focal length lens corresponds to the central part of this wide field of

82
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,669
看图。所以在宽视野图像的这个中心部分，其中“U”和
view image. So in this central part of the wide field of view image where the "U" and

83
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:06,270
“V”坐标很小，我们得到这种运动模糊。我们无法判断相机是否合适
"V" coordinates are small we get this motion ambiguity. We can't tell whether the camera

84
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:12,449
正在旋转或翻译。但是，即使在U和V很大的图像周边，
is rotating or translating. But, even in the periphery of the image where U and V are large,

85
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:17,900
动议一点也不含糊。相机旋转和相机转换非常原因，
the motion is not ambiguous at all. Camera rotation and camera translation cause very,

86
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:25,100
光流现象非常不同。这种模糊性肯定与焦距有关。
very different optical flow phenomenon. This ambiguity is very definitely related to the focal length.

87
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:30,020
显然，旋转运动和平移运动是非常非常不同的。但是，什么
Clearly rotational motion and translational motion are very, very different. But, what

88
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:35,810
我们刚才说的是使用图像传感器;就像我们的眼睛一样，这是不可能的
we've just been saying is that using an image sensor; just like our eye that it is not possible

89
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:41,970
让我们一般地说出一些旋转运动和一些平移运动之间的区别。
for us to tell in general the difference between some rotational motions and some translational motions.

90
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:48,100
当然，这将成为使用视觉来控制机器人的一个障碍。而且有点儿
Surely this would be a showstopper for using vision to control robots. And it is a bit

91
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:53,849
问题和解决问题的一种方法是使用单独的传感器来测量旋转。
of a problem and one way to get around that is to use a separate sensor to measure rotation.

92
00:07:53,849 --> 00:07:59,349
这是一张旋转测量单元的图片，里面有陀螺仪传感器
So this is a picture of a rotational measurement unit which has got gyroscope sensors in it

93
00:07:59,349 --> 00:08:05,690
它可以独立测量机器人的旋转，我们可以使用这些额外的信息
which can measure independently the rotation of a robot and we can use this extra information

94
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:10,160
消除我们从视觉传感器获得的信息的歧义。
to disambiguate the information that we get from our visual sensor.

95
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:16,720
但是，我们呢？我们有眼睛，清楚地告诉我们，我们可以很容易地确定我们是否在旋转
But, what about us? We have our eyes and clearly for us we can easily determine if we are rotating

96
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:23,810
或者我们是否正在翻译。是的，我们可以，但为此，我们也使用惯性传感器。
or whether we are translating. Yes we can, but to do that we also use inertial sensors.

97
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:29,129
我们实际上有旋转传感器。在我们的内耳中有这三个
We actually have rotational sensors in our head. In our inner ear there are these three

98
00:08:29,129 --> 00:08:34,680
半圆形运河，它们测量我们头部的角速度，我们有三个
semi-circular canals and they measure the angular velocity of our head and we have three

99
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:40,000
我们左耳的传感器和右耳的三个传感器。而我们的大脑融合了
sensors in our left ear and three sensors in our right ear. And our brain fuses the

100
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:44,920
来自我们内耳的旋转信息和我们的光流信息
rotational information that comes from our inner ear with our optical flow information

101
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:46,320
来自我们的眼睛。
that comes from our eyes.

102
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:52,370
它融合在我们的大脑中，它为我们提供了一个关于我们运动的非常明确的信息
It is fused in our brain it gives us a very unambiguous information about our motion whether

103
00:08:52,370 --> 00:08:55,320
我们正在轮换或是否正在翻译。
we're rotating or whether we are translating.

104
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,060
这是一种非常强大的错觉。
This is a very very powerful illusion.

105
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:14,600
我在旋转的鼓里面，我的眼睛可以检测到这个鼓的运动。
I am inside a rotating drum, and my eye can detect the motion of this drum.

106
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:20,400
我的眼睛和大脑正在计算我们所谓的光流和光流
My eye and my brain are computing what we call optical flow, and this optical flow

107
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:26,280
由旋转鼓引起的是与我以这种方式旋转头部时相同的光学流动，
that’s caused by that rotating drum is the same sort of optical flow that I get if I rotate my head this way,

108
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:28,500
或者我这样转动我的头。
or I rotate my head that way.

109
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:32,620
而这种特殊的幻觉让我感到有点不安，
And this particular illusion causes me to feel a little bit uneasy,

110
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:36,080
因为我用眼睛得到的信息-光流-
because the information that I get with my eyes — the optical flow —

111
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:38,620
告诉我，我的头在左右移动，
tells me that my head is moving from side to side,

112
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:43,580
但我耳朵里的陀螺仪传感器告诉我，这种情况并没有发生。
but the gyroscopic sensors in my ears tell me that’s not happening.

113
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:48,400
因此，我的耳朵告诉我的态度之间存在脱节，
So there’s a disconnect between what my ears are telling me about my attitude,

114
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:51,020
我的眼睛告诉我的动作是什么，
and what my eyes are telling me about my motion,

115
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:56,580
这会导致晕船或轻微恶心的感觉，
and that leads to the sensation of seasickness or a slight nausea,

116
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,760
这就是我坚持这些铁轨的原因。
which is why I’m holding on very tightly to these rails.
