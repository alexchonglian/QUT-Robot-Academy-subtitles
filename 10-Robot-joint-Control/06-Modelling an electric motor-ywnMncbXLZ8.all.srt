00:00:03,709 --> 00:00:08,450
旋转电动机可以通过该电气原理图建模。重要组成部分
A rotary electric motor can be modelled by this electrical schematic. Important components

2
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:13,349
该型号的电阻是电阻，这是电枢线圈的电阻。
of the model are a resistor and this is the resistance of the armature coil.

3
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:18,279
那是转子中的电磁铁。另一个组件是电压源。电机
That's the electromagnet in the rotor. The other component is a voltage source. A motor

4
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:23,099
可以反向用作发电机，但即使它作为电动机发电机也是如此
can be used in reverse as a generator but even when it's acting as a motor the generator

5
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:28,550
产生的电压与施加的电压相反，这被称为背面
is producing a voltage that opposes the applied voltage and this is referred to as the back

6
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:34,140
EMF。并且该电压与电动机的转速成比例。
EMF. And this voltage is proportional to the rotational speed of the motor.

7
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,539
流入电动机的电流由施加的电压之差给出
The current that flows into the motor is given by the difference between the applied voltage

8
00:00:38,539 --> 00:00:44,260
费用和反电动势电压VB除以电枢电阻RA。
fee and the back EMF voltage VB divided by the armature resistance RA.

9
00:00:44,260 --> 00:00:49,530
电机产生的转矩与流过电机的电流成正比
The torque generated by the motor is proportional to the current that flows through the motor

10
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:55,019
比例常数是KM。这两个KM虽然具有完全相同的价值
and the proportionality constant is KM. These two KMs have exactly the same value though

11
00:00:55,019 --> 00:01:00,149
它们通常用不同的单位编写。这里的这个单位为伏特秒
they're written typically with different units. This one here has units of volts seconds per

12
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:05,050
弧度。这里有一个牛顿米每安培的单位，但需要一点努力
radian. This one here has units of Newton meters per Amp but with a little bit of effort

13
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,810
你可以证明这两个单位实际上是等价的。
you can show that these two units are in fact equivalent.

14
00:01:07,810 --> 00:01:12,390
有两种方法可以控制电动机。我们可以控制电压或者我们可以
There are two ways to control an electric motor. We can control the voltage or we can

15
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,180
控制当前。
control the current.

16
00:01:14,180 --> 00:01:18,869
让我们首先看看电压控制情况。所以我们要调整电压
Let's first of all look at the voltage control case. So we're going to adjust the voltage

17
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:23,729
我们应用于电机，我们可以使用功率放大器或类似的东西
that we apply to the motor and we can do that using a power amplifier or something like

18
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:28,659
带调制器的脉冲。我们很快就会看到这一点。我写下了所有相关内容
a pulse with modulator. And we'll look at that shortly. I've written down all the relevant

19
00:01:28,659 --> 00:01:33,549
等式，如果我重新排列这个等式，我们可以得到旋转的表达式
equation and if I rearrange this equation we can get an expression for the rotational

20
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:38,299
速度欧姆加在施加电压方面的电流等。
speed omega in terms of the applied voltage the current and so on.

21
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:42,659
想象一下，电机在静止时启动，我施加电压，电流和电机
Imagine that the motor starts at rest and I apply a voltage, current flows and the motor

22
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:48,840
将开始加快速度。正如它所做的那样，反电动势将最终增加
will start to increase in speed. As it does so the back EMF will increase and eventually

23
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,600
反电动势将等于施加的电压，然后没有电流流入
the back EMF will be equal to the applied voltage and then no current will flow into

24
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:58,640
电机。然后电机将停止加速，当发生这种情况时，我们会有一个简单的表达式
the motor. The motor will then stop accelerating and when this occurs we have a simple expression

25
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,469
对于Omega，它是施加的电压除以电机常数。
for Omega it's the applied voltage divided by the motor constant.

26
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:07,609
现在在实践中，电机已经摩擦，并且在实践中使得电机的速度更快
Now in practice the motor has got friction and in practice that makes the speed of the

27
00:02:07,609 --> 00:02:12,720
电机小于此处显示的值。重要的是拿走了速度
motor less than the value shown here. The important take away is that the speed of the

28
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,970
电动机与施加的电压成比例。最常见的驱动电动机的方法
motor is proportional to the applied voltage. The most common way to drive an electric motor

29
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:23,730
今天是所谓的H桥电路。它包括四个开关，它们通常是
today is with what's called an H bridge circuit. It comprises four switches and they’re typically

30
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,190
某种场效应晶体管。它们非常小，而且非常有效
some kind of field effect transistor. They're very small and they're very efficient when

31
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:31,270
他们关闭了他们有一个非常小的阻力。
they're closed they have a very very small resistance.

32
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:35,700
如图所示，没有电流可以流过电机但是如果我关闭其中两个开关
As shown here no current can flow through the motor but if I close two of the switches

33
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:39,440
然后我们看到电流将在一个特定的方向流过电机
then we see the current will flow through the motor in one particular direction and

34
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:43,680
电机将向前旋转。如果我打开那两个开关并关闭
the motor will rotate in the forward direction. If I open those two switches and close the

35
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:49,220
另外两个，电流在另一个方向上流过电动机，电动机向后旋转。
other two, current flows in the other direction through the motor and the motor rotates backwards.

36
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:53,890
这些电子馈电开关的一个优点是我们可以打开和关闭它们
One of the advantages of these electronic fed switches is that we can them on and off

37
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:58,360
很快。施加到电机的电压可以是一段时间内的最大值
very quickly. The voltage that's applied to the motor can be the maximum value for a time

38
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:03,020
我们称之为准时的时期，我们称之为的时期为零
period which we refer to as the on time and there can zero for what we refer to as the

39
00:03:03,020 --> 00:03:07,980
关闭时间。并且驱动H桥电路的电子设备能够控制
off time. And the electronics which is driving the H bridge circuit is able to control the

40
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:13,010
占空比。这是导通时间与周期的比率，这可能与电压不同
duty cycle. That's the ratio of the on time to the period and this can vary from the voltage

41
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:17,140
始终关闭始终打开的电压。
being always off to the voltage being always on.

42
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:22,490
电机响应平均电压。所以这是一个占空比的例子
The motor responds to the average voltage. So here's an example where the duty cycle

43
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:29,050
相对较低的是电压关闭的时间比开启的时间长。和电机
is relatively low that is the voltage is off for more time than it is on. And the motor

44
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:34,070
当我增加占空比时，我看到红线所示的有效平均电压
sees an effective average voltage shown by the red line as I increase the duty cycle

45
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:38,760
平均电压上升，我可以进一步增加占空比。
the average voltage rises and I can increase the duty cycle even further.

46
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,280
因此，通过调整微控制器可以很容易地完成的占空比，
So by adjusting the duty cycle which is something that a micro controller can do quite easily,

47
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,530
我们可以以几乎连续的方式控制平均电压。这种转换发生了
we can control the average voltage in an almost continuous fashion. This switching happens

48
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:52,560
非常非常快，通常频率至少为1kHz。
very very quickly, typically a frequency of at least 1 kHz.

49
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,110
控制电动机的另一种方法是调节流过的电流
An alternative way of controlling the electric motor is to regulate the current that flows

50
00:03:57,110 --> 00:04:00,990
进入电机。有许多方法可以创建控制电流源。
into the motor. There are many ways to create a control current source.

51
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:06,610
常见的方法是采用控制电压源并施加电流反馈回路。
A common way is to take a control voltage source and apply a current feedback loop.

52
00:04:06,610 --> 00:04:11,520
电动机产生的转矩与流过电动机的电流成比例。
The torque generated by the motor is proportional to the current flowing through the motor.

53
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:17,320
扭矩也等于电动机的转动惯量乘以其转动
The torque is also equal to the rotational inertia of the motor multiplied by its rotational

54
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:23,770
加速。这是等式F=MA的旋转等效。现在我们可以写一个
acceleration. This is the rotational equivalent of the equation F = MA. Now we can write an

55
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:30,150
根据流入电动机的电流表示电动机的旋转加速度。
expression for the rotational acceleration of the motor in terms of the current flowing into the motor.
