1
00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:07,799
最简单和最常见的摩擦模型称为线性摩擦，有时也称为线性摩擦
The simplest and most common model of friction is called linear friction, sometimes also

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,350
称为粘性摩擦或粘性阻尼。然后，力或扭矩成比例
called viscous friction or viscous damping. Then, the force or the torque is proportional

3
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:18,750
速度。所以，有两种情况。我们可以考虑一个我们有摩擦的线性情况
to velocity. So, there are two cases. We can consider a linear case where we have friction

4
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,060
力与速度成正比，v，或者我们可以将旋转情况与摩擦力相对应
force proportional to velocity, v, or we can have the rotational case where a frictional

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:31,070
扭矩tau与转速omega成正比。如果我们用力量对抗速度，
torque, tau, is proportional to the rotational speed, omega. If we plot force against velocity,

6
00:00:31,070 --> 00:00:36,430
我们可以通过斜率B的直线来表示摩擦的特性并参考
we can represent the characteristic of friction by a straight line of slope B and refer to

7
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:41,090
B作为摩擦系数。通常，线的斜率为正
B as the friction coefficient. Typically, the slope of the line for positive

8
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:45,850
和负速度是一样的。这是电流控制电动的模型
and negative velocities is the same. Here is the model for a current controlled electric

9
00:00:45,850 --> 00:00:50,879
我们之前介绍的电机。它将旋转加速度与施加的电流相关联。
motor that we introduced earlier. It relates the rotation acceleration to the applied current.

10
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,769
而且，我将在这里添加摩擦力矩项。而且，摩擦是一个真正的问题
And, I’m going to add a frictional torque term here. And, friction is a real issue in

11
00:00:55,769 --> 00:01:00,609
大多数电动机。摩擦是由于轴在轴内旋转的轴承造成的。
most electric motors. The friction is due to the bearings that the shaft rotates within.

12
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:05,320
并且，对于带刷子的电动机，这代表了刷子摩擦的摩擦力
And, for motors with brushes this represents the frictional force of the brushes rubbing on

13
00:01:05,320 --> 00:01:09,100
电机的换向器。我可以重新排列方程式
the motor’s Commutator. I can rearrange the equation to look like

14
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:14,450
这个然后我可以转换它并将其转换为传递函数形式。所以，我们在这里
this and then I can transform it and put it into transfer function form. So, here we

15
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:20,240
具有电动机的传递功能，并且它包含电动机扭矩
have the transfer function for an electric motor and it incorporates the motor torque

16
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,479
恒定，电机的惯性和电机的摩擦力。一些系统展出
constant, the inertia of the motor and the friction of the motor. Some systems exhibit

17
00:01:25,479 --> 00:01:29,840
非线性摩擦和最经典的情况称为库仑摩擦
a nonlinear friction and the most classic case of this is known as Coulomb friction

18
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,990
这是以一位着名的法国物理学家的名字命名的，他也在静电方面做了很多工作
and this is named after a famous French physicist who also did a lot of work in electrostatics

19
00:01:34,990 --> 00:01:39,140
电荷单位以同一位绅士的名字命名。
and the unit of electric charge is named after this same gentleman.

20
00:01:39,140 --> 00:01:43,860
就像我们之前看到的线性摩擦一样，非线性摩擦力总是相反的
Like the linear friction we looked at before, the nonlinear friction force always opposes

21
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:48,299
运动的方向。有趣的是，库仑摩擦没有定义
the direction of motion. Interestingly, Coulomb friction is not defined

22
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:53,080
对于零速度的情况。我们定义机构移动时的摩擦量
for the case of zero velocity. We define the amount of friction when the mechanism is moving

23
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:57,600
在正方向和机构向负方向移动时，这些
in the positive direction and when the mechanism is moving in the negative direction, and these

24
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,850
值可以相同，也可以不同。这取决于机制。
values may be the same or they may be different. It depends on the mechanism.

25
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:06,450
对于真正的机器，摩擦实际上是这两种效果的组合，即
For a real machine, friction is actually a combination of both these two effects, the

26
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:11,150
非线性库仑摩擦和线性摩擦。再次，这个摩擦曲线
nonlinear Coulomb friction and the linear friction. Once again, this friction curve

27
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:16,599
没有为零速度的情况定义。这两个术语可以相同或不同
is not defined for the case of zero velocity. These two terms may be the same or different

28
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:21,080
并且正负速度线的斜率可以相同或者相等
and the slope of the line for positive and negative velocities may be the same or it

29
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,870
可能会有所不同。再一次，它取决于特定的机器。
may be different. Once again, it depends on the particular machine.
