1
00:00:03,530 --> 00:00:07,770
现代电动机是很好的设备，但它们的性能有限。
Modern electric motors are wonderful devices, but there are limits to their performance.

2
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:12,759
有最大加速度，最大速度和最大功率。
There is a maximum acceleration, a maximum velocity and a maximum power.

3
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:18,380
那么，让我们首先看一下限制电机加速度的因素。我们已经重新安排了
So, let’s look first at what limits the acceleration of a motor. We have rearranged

4
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:23,410
此处此形式的早期等式，电机转矩与电机的比率
an earlier equation in to this form here, the ratio of the motor torque to the motor

5
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:28,290
惯性。很明显，因为惯性在分母中，如果我们增加惯性，我们就是
inertia. Clearly because inertia is in the denominator, if we increase inertia, we are

6
00:00:28,290 --> 00:00:34,050
要减少加速度。电机经受的惯性有两个组成部分。
going to reduce the acceleration. The inertia that the motor experiences has got two components.

7
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,160
其中一个组件是电机电枢的惯性。那是旋转的
One of those components is the inertia of the motor’s armature. That’s the rotating

8
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,890
我用Jsubm表示的电动机的一部分。电机经历的另一个惯性
part of electric motor that I denote by J sub m. The other inertia that the motor experiences

9
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,360
是由于链接本身。在这种情况下，我绘制了一个非常简单的矩形
is due to the link itself. In this case, I have drawn a very simple rectangular

10
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:54,230
链接的棱镜和惯性是M倍R平方。R平方是有问题的
prism for the link and the inertia of that is M times R squared. The R squared is problematic

11
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:58,320
因为它意味着惯性随着链接的大小而迅速增长。
because it means that the inertia grows very quickly with the size of the link.

12
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,440
因此，我们可以根据这两个组成部分编写电机所经历的总惯性，
So, we can write the total inertia that the motor experiences in terms of these two components,

13
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:08,000
电动机电枢惯性是一个常数和链路的惯性。而且，在这
the motor armature inertia which is a constant and the inertia of the link. And, in this

14
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,180
简单的情况下，链接的惯性是一个常数。但是，对于真正的机器人来说，惯性
simple case, the inertia of the link is a constant. But, for a real robot, the inertia

15
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:17,110
将取决于附加到末尾的所有链接的配置
is going to depend on the configuration of all the links that are attached to the end

16
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:22,470
这个特定链接以及链中最后一个链接所持有的有效载荷。
of this particular link and also to the payload which is held by the last link in the chain.

17
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:27,360
因此，链路惯性将变化很大。然而，在真正的机器人中，有
So, the link inertia is going to be highly variable. However, in a real robot, there's

18
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,950
通常是电机和链路之间的变速箱，这是另一个优点
typically a gearbox between the motor and the link and this is another advantage of

19
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:36,759
变速箱因为它允许我像这样写惯性表达式。
the gearbox because it allows me to write the expression for inertia like this.

20
00:01:36,759 --> 00:01:41,829
链路的惯性减小了G平方因子。而且，对于像Puma这样的机器人，
The inertia of the link is reduced by a factor of G squared. And, for a robot like the Puma,

21
00:01:41,829 --> 00:01:47,859
G是一个介于10和100之间的数字。因此，链接惯性将是
G is a number anywhere between say 10 and a 100. So, the link inertia is going to be

22
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:52,880
大大减少了。这意味着电机控制系统的惯性
greatly reduced. It means that the inertia that the motor control system is going to

23
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:58,109
“看”是由恒定的电动机电枢惯性决定的。
“see” is dominated by the constant motor armature inertia.

24
00:01:58,109 --> 00:02:04,181
由链路配置变化引起的惯性变化将非常非常小。如果
Variation in inertia due to link configuration change is going to be very, very small. If

25
00:02:04,181 --> 00:02:09,229
我们现在考虑表达式顶部的分子，我们知道最大扭矩
we consider now the numerator of the expression at the top, we know that the maximum torque

26
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:14,120
取决于最大电流。最大可能电流是功率的函数
depends on the maximum current. The maximum possible current is a function of the power

27
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,720
为电动机提供电流的放大器。如果我们给电机施加太多电流，
amplifier which supplies current to the motor. If we apply too much current to the motor,

28
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,709
电枢和电刷会过热而损坏。
the armature and the brushes will overheat and be damaged.

29
00:02:21,709 --> 00:02:27,390
另外，请记住，电机产生的一些扭矩用于抵抗摩擦和
Also, remember that some of the torque generated by the motor is used to oppose friction and

30
00:02:27,390 --> 00:02:32,920
也反对电机的重力。因此，实际上可用于加速的较少。
also to oppose gravity in the motor. So, less of it is actually available for acceleration.

31
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:39,290
我们在这里定义的是机器人关节最大加速度的上限。
What we have defined here is an upper bound on the maximum acceleration of the robot joint.

32
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:43,849
现在转到电机的电气模型所包含的最大速度
Turning now to the maximum velocity the electrical model for the motor contains

33
00:02:43,849 --> 00:02:48,849
一个发电机，圆圈是反电动势源，随着电机旋转越来越快，
a generator, the circle is the back EMF source, and as the motor rotates faster and faster, the

34
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:54,269
反电动势上升。并且，当反电动势等于施加的电压时，则不再有电流
back EMF rises. And, when the back EMF equals the applied voltage, then no further current

35
00:02:54,269 --> 00:03:00,430
可以流入电机。它将停止加速，并将定义最大速度
can flow in to motor. It will stop accelerating and that will define the maximum speed of

36
00:03:00,430 --> 00:03:05,549
由这样的等式给出的电动机。给出了电动机的电功率
the motor given by an equation like this. The electrical power in to the motor is given

37
00:03:05,549 --> 00:03:09,659
通过施加的电压和电流的乘积。电机的机械功率
by the product of the applied voltage and current. The mechanical power out of the motor

38
00:03:09,659 --> 00:03:15,049
是速度和扭矩的产物。我们可以根据电机速度绘制电机扭矩
is the product of speed and the torque. We can plot motor torque against motor speed

39
00:03:15,049 --> 00:03:18,390
此曲线还有其他两个关键点。
and there are other two critical points on this curve.

40
00:03:18,390 --> 00:03:22,519
有一点是电机完全没有负载并且它的旋转速度尽可能快
One point is when the motor has got no load at all and it’s spinning as fast as it possibly

41
00:03:22,519 --> 00:03:27,220
能够。我们称之为空载速度。在线的另一端，电机是
can. We refer to this as the no load speed. At the other end of the line, the motor is

42
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:31,840
停滞不前。它实际上不是在旋转，而是在施加扭矩，我们参考这个
stalled. It’s not actually rotating but it is exerting a torque and we refer to this

43
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:36,049
作为失速扭矩。功率是速度的二次函数
as the stall torque. Power is a quadratic function of speed has

44
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:40,920
最大值在电机运行速度范围的中间位置，电机不能
a maximum somewhere in the middle of the operating speed range of the motor and the motor cannot

45
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:45,409
操作一段时间超过其最大额定功率，否则它
be operated for a sustained period of time above its maximum power rating or else it

46
00:03:45,409 --> 00:03:47,119
会因过热而损坏。
will be damaged through overheating.
