1
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,809
在早期的一次演讲中，我们讨论了数据不匹配问题。这就是事实
In a much earlier lecture, we talked about the data mismatch problem. That's the fact

2
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:14,440
像相机这样的传感器发出大量像素，可能是100万像素
that a sensor like a camera emits a large number of pixels, perhaps 1 million pixels

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:21,020
在每个图像中，它将输出每秒10到50个图像的任何内容
in every image and it's going to be outputting anything from 10 to 50 images per second that is an

4
00:00:21,020 --> 00:00:22,890
大量的数据。
enormous amount of data.

5
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:27,550
像机器人这样的机器需要相对较少的信息才能告诉它在哪里
A machine like a robot requires relatively little information in order to tell it where

6
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:34,110
去这里所示的臂式机械手只需要6个数字来描述
to go an arm type manipulator like shown here requires simply 6 numbers which described

7
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,730
机器人关节的角度。
the angles of the joints of the robot.

8
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:41,710
像真空吸尘器这样的移动机器人在这里显示实际上只需要2个数字来控制
A mobile robot like the vacuum cleaner shows here really only requires 2 numbers to control

9
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:46,760
它的运动，即它的前进速度V和它的旋转速度omega。
its motion, that's its forward velocity V and its rotational velocity omega.

10
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:51,620
因此，相对而言，我们遇到来自相机传感器的大量数据的问题
So, we have the problem with a huge amount of data coming from a camera sensor, relatively

11
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:56,350
机器人所需的数据很少。我们解决这个问题的方法是提取什么
little data required by the robot. The way we get around that then is to extract what

12
00:00:56,350 --> 00:01:01,579
我们从图像中调用特征，我们在之前的关于区域的讲座中谈了一些
we call features from the image and we've talked a bit in previous lectures about region

13
00:01:01,579 --> 00:01:07,390
特征。我们已经讨论过如何获取导入图像。我们可以找到哪些地区
features. We've talked about how we can take an import image. We can find regions which

14
00:01:07,390 --> 00:01:14,340
是具有相似强度或相似颜色的像素组，然后我们可以描述
are sets of pixels with either similar intensity or with similar color and we can then describe

15
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,670
那些区域的质心，边界框，时刻周长，
those regions in terms of their centroid, their bounding box, moment’s perimeter,

16
00:01:19,670 --> 00:01:21,250
圆形等。
circularity and so on.

17
00:01:21,250 --> 00:01:25,619
我们已经谈了很多关于地区的事情，但是还有很多其他类型的功能
We've talked a lot about regions but there are number of other types of features that

18
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:29,700
非常有用和有趣，我想谈谈一下。
are really useful and interesting and that I'd like to talk a little bit about.

19
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,270
大多数真实场景包含很多行。这是一个教堂的特殊图片，我
Most real world scenes contain a lot of lines. This particular picture of a church, I've

20
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:40,140
突出了很多行。其中一些线条来自屋顶之间的对比
highlighted a number of lines. Some of these lines come from the contrast between the roof

21
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:46,000
和天空，在屋顶和墙壁之间，窗户的边缘，门的边缘和
and the sky, between the roof and the wall, the edges of windows, the edges of doors and

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,799
等等。当然，在任何人造环境中，都有大量的线条，甚至是
so on. Certainly, in any man-made environment, there are enormous number of lines but even

23
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,820
在许多自然环境中也有线条，也许是树木的垂直边缘
in many natural environments there are lines as well, perhaps the vertical edges of tree

24
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:56,070
树干等等。
trunks and so on.

25
00:01:56,070 --> 00:02:02,369
因此，线条在环境中非常普遍，线条非常简单和紧凑。
So, lines are very prevalent in the environment and lines are very simple and compact to describe.

26
00:02:02,369 --> 00:02:07,290
一条线可能包含大量像素，但实际上仅用2个参数描述，
A line might contain a large number of pixels but is really described by just 2 parameters,

27
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:09,020
它的拦截和它的斜率。
its intercept and its slope.

28
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:14,080
现在，一个有趣的问题是：我们如何在图像中提取线条，重要的是，
Now, an interesting question then is: How do we extract lines in an image, the important,

29
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:16,319
图像中的主导线？
the dominant lines within an image?

30
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,190
我们称之为点特征的另一类特征以及覆盖在这张图上的内容
Another class of features what we call point features and what's overlaid on this picture

31
00:02:21,190 --> 00:02:27,930
这里的建筑物是图像中有趣的点，也就是他们所描述的
of a building here are points in the image that are interesting, that is they describe

32
00:02:27,930 --> 00:02:32,459
这些点非常有特色，如果我拍下这栋建筑的另一张照片，我会
points that are quite distinctive and if I took another picture of this building, I'd

33
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:37,459
很有可能在同一建筑物的不同视图中找到相同的点。
have a pretty good chance of finding those same points in a different view of the same building.

34
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,040
所以，如果我移动相机，如果太阳出来，太阳就会落在云层后面，我愿意
So, if I'd move my camera, if the sun's come out, the sun's going behind the cloud, I would

35
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,750
仍然能够找到这些点。重叠的图形信息需要很多
still be able to locate these points. The overlaid graphical information entails a lot

36
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:53,950
关于这些特征点。圆圈的中心表示这个独特的中心
about these feature points. The centre of the circle indicates the centre of this distinctive

37
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:58,959
模式，这是我们很可能在另一个视图中找到的模式
pattern that is a pattern that we are very likely to be able to find in another view

38
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:00,530
相同的场景。
of the same scene.

39
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:04,830
圆的大小表示模式的比例。这是非常的
The size of the circle indicates something about the scale of the pattern. Is it a very

40
00:03:04,830 --> 00:03:10,239
小的独特图案或大的独特图案？无线电线说了些什么
small distinct pattern or a large distinct pattern? The radio lines say something about

41
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,379
该模式的方向。
the orientation of that pattern.
