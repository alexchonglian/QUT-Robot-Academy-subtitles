00:00:03,369 --> 00:00:07,630
在本讲座中，我们将继续讨论图像处理
In this lecture we're going to continue an earlier discussion about image processing

2
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:13,060
并学习一些有趣且有用的先进技术。图像处理
and pick up on a couple of more advance techniques that are interesting and useful. Image processing

3
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:14,939
是一个非常巨大的领域。
is a really huge area.

4
00:00:14,939 --> 00:00:19,460
有一些大量的教科书可以很详细地介绍它。更多细节和
There are some massive textbooks that cover it in a lot of detail. Much more detail and

5
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,700
比我希望在这里做的更多。但我想向您介绍几种技巧
than I can hope to do here. But I want to just introduce you to a couple of techniques

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:25,690
我认为真的很有用。
that I think really are useful.

7
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:29,300
我们要揭示的第一件事是数学形态学。我们离开的地方
The first thing we going to reveal is the mathematical morphology. And where we left

8
00:00:29,300 --> 00:00:34,670
它，我们可以使用形状滤镜，可以检测不同的正方形或矩形
it, we could use shape filters that could detect squares or rectangles of different

9
00:00:34,670 --> 00:00:39,510
大小。在这里，我们将扩展它并看看我们如何检测可能的形状
sizes. Here we going to extend that and look at how we can detect shapes that are perhaps

10
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:42,640
对角线或圆圈。
diagonal lines or circles.

11
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:47,280
我们要访问的第二种技术是我们所谓的图像变形。这是公平的
The second technique we are going to visit is what we call image warping. This is a fairly

12
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,030
一般技术，允许我们改变图像的形状，我们将去
general technique that allows us to change the shape of an image and we are going to

13
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:56,619
看看我们如何使图像更大或更小的一些例子，关于我们如何做到
look at some examples about how we can make an image larger or smaller, about how we can

14
00:00:56,619 --> 00:00:59,780
旋转图像或我们如何移动图像。
rotate an image or about how we can shift an image.
