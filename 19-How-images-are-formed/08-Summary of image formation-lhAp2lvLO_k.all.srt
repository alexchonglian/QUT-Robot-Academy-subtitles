1
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,069
让我们回顾一下我们在这个特定讲座中所涉及的一些重要主题。我们已经
Let's recap some of the important topics we've covered in this particular lecture. We've

2
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:13,130
谈到了基本的图像形成过程，最简单的情况就是我们所说的
talked about the fundamental image formation process and the simplest case is what we call

3
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:18,380
“针孔相机”。光线来自光源，在这种情况下，太阳会反射出来
the "Pinhole Camera." Light comes from a light source, in this case the sun, reflects off

4
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:24,119
在三维物体上的点，那些光线穿过针孔并引起
points on the three dimensional object, those light rays pass through the pin hole and cause

5
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,760
在图像平面上形成非常微弱的倒置图像。
a very faint inverted image to be formed on the image plane.

6
00:00:28,760 --> 00:00:33,260
可以非常简单地解释这种情况的几何形状。它可以用来描述
The geometry of this situation can be very simply explained. It can be described using

7
00:00:33,260 --> 00:00:37,600
类似的三角形，这导致我们三者之间非常简单的关系
similar triangles and that leads us to the very simple relationship here between three

8
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,579
维数世界坐标，大写字母X，大写字母Y，大写字母Z和二维
dimensional world coordinates, capital X, capital Y, capital Z and the two dimensional

9
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:45,840
图像平面坐标小x和小y。
image plane coordinates little x and little y.

10
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,239
因此，这是从三维到二维的映射或投影
So this is a mapping or a projection from three dimensions down to two dimensions and

11
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:54,219
这被称为“透视投影”。
this is called "Perspective Projection."

12
00:00:54,219 --> 00:00:59,680
针孔成像模型的一个缺点是许多光线都是
One of the disadvantages of the pinhole imaging model is that a lot of the light rays are

13
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,720
丢失;他们只是碰到了持有针孔的不透明平面。如果我们介绍一个镜头
lost; they simply hit the opaque plane that holds the pinhole. If we introduce a lens

14
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,170
相反，我们能够收集更多离开每个特定点的光线
instead we're able to gather many more of the rays that leave each particular point

15
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:14,270
在物体上，可以形成更明亮的图像。
on the object and that allows a brighter image to be formed.

16
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:19,250
透视投影的结果，从三维到下的映射
A consequence of the perspective projection, the mapping from three dimensions down into

17
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:25,680
二，是不保留一些几何。在这里，我们看到世界上的平行线
two, is that some of the geometry is not preserved. Here we see that parallel lines in the world

18
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:31,159
不再是图像中的平行线。我们看到世界上有一个大圈子
are no longer parallel lines in the image. We see that a large circle in the world is

19
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:37,360
不是图像中的圆圈。透视投影只保证这样做，它
not a circle in the image. And perspective projection guarantees only to do this, it

20
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,630
将一条线映射到一条线，但它不一定保持平行，角度是
will map a line to a line, but it doesn't necessarily retain parallelism, angles are

21
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:48,130
不一定保留，圆锥曲线部分映射到圆锥曲线;这意味着
not necessarily preserved and conic sections are mapped to conic sections; so that means

22
00:01:48,130 --> 00:01:53,720
圆圈可以显示为椭圆，椭圆可以显示为圆形。
that a circle could appear as an ellipse and an ellipse could appear as a circle.

23
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:59,219
透视投影的一个非常重要的结果是没有独特的逆。
A really important consequence of the perspective projection is that there is no unique inverse.

24
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:05,130
我们已经失去了一个维度，因此对于特定的图像，存在无限多的可能
We've lost a dimension, so for a particular image there are an infinite number of possible

25
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:10,629
可能导致该图像的对象。它可能是一个靠近我的小物体
objects that could have caused that image. It could be a small object close to me or

26
00:02:10,629 --> 00:02:16,810
它可能是一个更远的大物体。没有办法，只能从图像几何上得到
it could be a large object further away. There is no way, just from the image geometry that

27
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:17,849
我们可以告诉你。
we can tell this.

28
00:02:17,849 --> 00:02:22,730
所以在实践中我们使用了一些技巧，这些技巧来自我们成长过程中的经验
So in practice we use a number of tricks that come from our experience from growing up in

29
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:29,520
一个三维世界，以消除歧义。虽然我们可以欺骗这个。如果我们创造
a three dimensional world, in order to disambiguate this. Though we can trick this. If we create

30
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,690
二维图像;在这里显示为一块街头艺术，它在视网膜上引起
a two dimensional image; shown here as a piece of street art, which causes on the retina

31
00:02:34,690 --> 00:02:41,209
我们的眼睛，与我们从三维世界看到的图像完全相同，
of our eye, exactly the same image as we would get from looking at a three dimensional world,

32
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:47,959
然后，我们大脑的所有三维解释部分都会启动并导致我们
then all of the three dimensional interpretation part of our brain kicks in and causes us to

33
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:53,970
感觉，即使理性部分，也将图像解释为三维
feel, to interpret the image as being three dimensional even though the rational part

34
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:59,950
我们的大脑知道这是一块平坦的街头艺术。印象还是很的，
of our brain knows that this is a piece of flat street art. The impression is still very,

35
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:01,110
非常生动。
very vivid.

36
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:05,620
另一种我们可以看到没有唯一逆的结果的方法是在
Another way we can look at the consequence of there being no unique inverse is in an

37
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:10,989
像这样的错觉，因为克里斯是一个全尺寸的人，但因为他站着
illusion like this and it's because Chris is a full size person but because he's standing

38
00:03:10,989 --> 00:03:15,569
更远的地方，他看起来更小，虽然最初我们对我们感到惊讶
further away he appears to be smaller and although initially we're surprised when we

39
00:03:15,569 --> 00:03:19,950
再看看我们理解三维的大脑的理性部分
look at that, again the rational part of our brain that understands the three dimensional

40
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:25,569
世界开始并说：“好吧，实际上我们会假设他是一个全尺寸的人，
world kicks in and says "Okay, actually we will assume that he is a full size person,

41
00:03:25,569 --> 00:03:27,700
因此，他必须离得更远。“
he therefore must be further away."
