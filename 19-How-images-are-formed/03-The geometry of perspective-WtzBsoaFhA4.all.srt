1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:09,520
我们来谈谈图像如何形成的几何形状。所有图像都以光线开始
Let’s talk about the geometry of how images are formed. All images start with light coming

2
00:00:09,520 --> 00:00:14,599
来自某些光源;也许是太阳，也许是天花板上的室内灯
from some source of illumination; perhaps the sun, perhaps indoor lights in the ceiling

3
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:19,180
建筑物的光线反射出世界上的物体。其中一些反映出来
of a building and that light reflects off objects in the world. Some of that reflected

4
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:25,269
光在我们眼中结束。反射有两种类型。有镜子般的反射
light ends up in our eyes. There are two types of reflection. There is the mirror-like reflection

5
00:00:25,269 --> 00:00:30,199
我们称之为镜面反射，并且存在漫反射或无光泽表面的反射，
we call specular reflection and there is the reflection from a diffuse or matte surface,

6
00:00:30,199 --> 00:00:33,230
这被称为朗伯反射。
which is called Lambertian reflection.

7
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:39,550
大多数表面是镜面反射和朗伯反射的混合。但无论如何
Most surfaces are a mixture of specular reflection and Lambertian reflection. But irrespective

8
00:00:39,550 --> 00:00:44,290
在发生的那种反射中，我们从光源反射光
of the sort of reflection that’s occurring, we have light from a light source reflecting

9
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:49,969
关闭物体，其中一些光线将进入我们的眼睛。我们来看看这个
off objects and some of those light rays are going to enter our eyes. Let’s look at this

10
00:00:49,969 --> 00:00:52,020
在图形表示中。
in a graphical representation.

11
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,730
我们再一次观察现场。我们有一个三维物体
Once again, we have our observer of the scene. We have a three-dimensional object in the

12
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:02,480
世界，我们将考虑在特定对象的几个点上发生的事情。
world and we’re going to consider what happens at just a few points on that particular object.

13
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,269
所以我们首先需要的是光源。
So the first thing we need is a source of light.

14
00:01:05,269 --> 00:01:10,500
我们打开太阳，现在将要发生的是光将从中反射出来
We turn on the sun and what’s going to happen now is light is going to be reflected from

15
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:15,470
太阳在许多这些点和一些光线将进入
the sun at a number of these points and some of those light rays are going to enter the

16
00:01:15,470 --> 00:01:19,700
观察者的眼睛。当我们看一个三维雕像
eyes of the observer. When we look at a three-dimensional statue

17
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:24,299
无论是通过相机还是用我们自己的眼睛，我们都会体验到非常生动的感觉
like this either through a camera or with our own eyes, we experience a very vivid and

18
00:01:24,299 --> 00:01:30,270
那个物体的清晰图像。但是，如果我只是在这里拿一张纸而且它正在接收
crisp image of that object. But if I simply hold up a piece of paper here and it is receiving

19
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:34,970
从雕像中反射出来的光，无论我看多么努力或有多紧密
light that’s reflected off the statue, then no matter how hard or how closely I look at

20
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:41,049
在这篇文章中，没有形成图像的概念。我们需要整理光明
this paper, there is no concept of image being formed on here. We need to organize the light

21
00:01:41,049 --> 00:01:45,240
光线，离开雕像，以获得清晰的图像。
rays, which are leaving the statue in order to get a crisp image.

22
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,770
那么让我们以图形方式看待这个问题。我们有一个图像平面，一张纸
So let’s look at this problem graphically. We have an image plane, the piece of paper

23
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:56,829
我刚刚举起，如果我考虑那个图像平面上的任何特定点，那么
that I just held up and if I consider any particular point on that image plane, the

24
00:01:56,829 --> 00:02:01,659
落在任何一个点上的光可能来自任意数量的点
light that’s falling on any single point could have come from any number of points

25
00:02:01,659 --> 00:02:06,250
在三维物体上。发生的事情是来自所有这些点的光
on the three-dimensional object. What’s happened is the light from all of those points

26
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:11,599
正在混淆，所以如果我只是拿起一张纸就没有连贯的图像了
is being mixed up so that if I just hold up a piece of paper no coherent image will be

27
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,900
形成于此。
formed on that.

28
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:16,810
我们需要做的是以某种方式订购光线和最简单的思考方式
What we need to do is to order the light rays in some way and the simplest way to think

29
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:22,370
关于这样做是为了在图像平面的前面放一个不透明的平面并钻一个
about doing this is to put an opaque plane in front of the image plane and to drill a

30
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:27,349
小洞里面。这是一种被称为针孔相机的配置。
small hole in it. This is a configuration that’s referred to as a pinhole camera.

31
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:33,390
这样做是为了对离开物体上的点的光线进行排序
What this does is order the rays that are leaving the points on the object and it causes

32
00:02:33,390 --> 00:02:39,290
在图像平面上形成的倒置（即倒置的图像）。这种方法
an inverted (that is an upside-down image) to be formed on the image plane. This approach

33
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:43,930
成像被称为针孔相机。有时它被称为相机暗箱，它是
to imaging is called a pinhole camera. Sometimes it’s called a camera obscura and it’s

34
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,450
自古以来就为人所知。
been known since ancient times.

35
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:51,349
这张照片显示了一座建筑物，墙上钻有一个小洞，发生了什么
This picture shows a building with a small hole drilled in its wall and what’s happening

36
00:02:51,349 --> 00:02:57,080
就是有一个外面明亮太阳的图像被投射在内墙上
is that there is an image of the bright sun outside is being cast on the interior wall

37
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,550
建筑物。
of the building.

38
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:03,470
以下是我从网上下载的针孔相机图像的一些示例。人
Here are some examples of pinhole camera images that I’ve downloaded from the web. People

39
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:07,239
他们已经观察过这些图像，或许它们已经进入了一个黑暗的房间里
have observed these images perhaps they’ve been inside a darkened room, there’s been

40
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:12,360
外面一个明亮的场景，一个阳光灿烂的日子，盲人可能还有一个洞
a bright scene outside, a bright sunny day and there’s been perhaps a hole on the blind

41
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:16,879
或窗户覆盖，并导致外部世界的形象投射在
or window covering and that has caused an image of the outside world to be cast on the

42
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:17,879
壁。
wall.

43
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:21,282
现在回想一下前一个例子，这个图像是倒置的。所以在左手
Now recall from the previous example that this image is inverted. So in the left-hand

44
00:03:21,282 --> 00:03:22,282
图像，这个人把他们的相机翻过来，你可以看到一个电动牙刷
image, the person like turned their camera upside-down and you can see an electric toothbrush

45
00:03:22,282 --> 00:03:23,282
从顶部悬挂和右手图像，你可以看到针孔的事实
hanging from the top and in the right-hand image, you can see the fact that the pinhole

46
00:03:23,282 --> 00:03:26,010
事实上，图像是倒置的。这是一个非常非常大的针孔相机的例子。这个
image is in fact inverted. Here is an example of a very, very large pinhole camera. This

47
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:32,409
这是一个惊人的项目，发生在2008年一个废弃的飞机库里
was an amazing project that happened in a disused aircraft hangar back in 2008. On the

48
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:37,590
离开时，我们可以看到一群人站在图像平面前。那是在哪里
left, we can see a bunch of people standing in front of the image plane. That’s where

49
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:42,730
来自针孔摄像机的图像已经投射，在右侧，你可以看到
the image from the pinhole camera has been cast and on the right-hand side, you can see

50
00:03:42,730 --> 00:03:47,400
他们努力实际拍摄这些图像，以便制作出非常非常大的作品
them endeavouring to actually capture that image so they made a very, very large piece

51
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,540
电影，一个非常大的负片，他们会把它靠在墙上暴露
of film, a very large negative and they’re going to put it up against the wall and expose

52
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:55,939
它使用这个针孔相机拍摄图像。
it and capture an image using this pinhole camera.

53
00:03:55,939 --> 00:04:01,860
因此，快速了解针孔相机会发生什么。光线离开各种各样
So, a quick refresher on what happens with a pinhole camera. Rays of light leave various

54
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:06,530
对象上的点。它们都穿过针孔并投下一张倒置的图像
points on the object. They all pass through the pinhole and cast an upside-down image

55
00:04:06,530 --> 00:04:09,180
我们称之为图像平面。
on what we call the image plane.

56
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:14,549
这个针孔相机的几何形状实际上很容易描述。我们会考虑
The geometry of this pinhole camera is actually very simple to describe. We’ll consider

57
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:19,850
该物体距离针孔平面和图像平面的距离为Z.
that the object is at a distance Z away from the plane of the pinhole and the image plane

58
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:26,040
是远离针孔平面的距离F（焦距F）。
is a distance F (F for focal distance) away from the plane of the pinhole.

59
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:33,270
然后，如果对象的高度为Y，则图像的高度为y，这些是两个
Then if the height of the object is Y, the height of the image is y and these are two

60
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:38,350
类似三角形。所以在这里写关系很容易。它很简单
similar triangles. So it’s very easy to write the relationship over here. It simply

61
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:45,139
来自我们有两个相似三角形的事实。我们也可以做同样的事情
comes from the fact that we’ve got two similar triangles. We can also do the same thing for

62
00:04:45,139 --> 00:04:51,030
水平面。我们引入符号X表示距离页面的距离
the horizontal plane. We introduce the symbol X for the distance out of the page of the

63
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:56,759
我们正在查看的对象和x在图像平面中沿着墙的距离。
object that we’re looking at and x for the distance along the wall in the image plane.

64
00:04:56,759 --> 00:05:03,440
我们可以再次编写来自查看两个相似三角形的方程式。所以
We can again write the equations that come from looking at two similar triangles. So

65
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:10,800
这个图像形成过程用坐标X，Y和Z映射世界中的一个点
this image formation process maps a point in the world with coordinates X, Y and Z to

66
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:17,940
图像平面上坐标为x和y的点。我们可以重新排列那些方程式
a point on the image plane whose coordinates are x and y. We can rearrange those equations

67
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,970
以这种方式。
in this fashion.

68
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:28,410
因此，如果x现在根据真实世界坐标X和Z，并且类似于y。所以这就是
So if x now in terms of the real world coordinates X and Z and similarly for y. So this is what

69
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:35,660
我们称之为预测。它将三维量X，Y，Z投影成二维量，
we call a projection. It projects a three-dimensional quantity X, Y, Z into a two-dimensional quantity,

70
00:05:35,660 --> 00:05:42,610
x和y。它是三维和二维之间的映射。
x and y. It is a mapping between three dimensions and two dimensions.

71
00:05:42,610 --> 00:05:48,860
这被称为透视投影。这是该过程的数学基础
This referred to as perspective projection. This is the mathematical basis for the process

72
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:55,250
我们称之为透视投影。透视投影的结果是
that we’d call perspective projection. A consequence of perspective projection is that

73
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:02,610
没有独特的逆。如果我在现实世界中有一个物体的图像，那么那里
there is no unique inverse. If I have an image of the object in the real world then there

74
00:06:02,610 --> 00:06:07,360
是可能导致该图像的无限数量的可能对象。它可能是一个
are an infinite number of possible objects that could cause that image. It could be a

75
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,340
靠近我的小物体，或者它可能是一个远离我的大物体
small object that’s close to me or it could be a large object that’s further away from

76
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,340
我。
me.

77
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:18,810
其中一个方面已经从根本上消失了。从二维图像，我们不能
One of the dimensions has been fundamentally lost. From a two-dimensional image, we cannot

78
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:25,020
恢复这第三个维度。现在，在我们的大脑中，我们使用了很多技巧来尝试
recover this third dimension. Now, in our brains, we use a lot of tricks to try and

79
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:28,789
恢复第三个维度。我们对这个结构有所了解
recover that third dimension. We know something about the structure of the

80
00:06:28,789 --> 00:06:33,039
世界。我们对物体的大小有所了解。所以，如果我们看到什么看起来像一个小
world. We know something about the size of objects. So if we see what looks like a small

81
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,729
我们认为“不，不，不，这可能是一个更远的人。”
person we think “No, no, no, it’s probably a large person who is further away.”

82
00:06:38,729 --> 00:06:45,030
因此，恢复第三个维度从根本上是不可能的，但还有其他信息
So to recover the third dimension is fundamentally impossible but there is other information

83
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,400
我们可以带来恢复它。
that we can bring to bear to recover it.
