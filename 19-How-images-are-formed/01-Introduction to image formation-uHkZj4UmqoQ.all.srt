1
00:00:03,590 --> 00:00:08,010
到目前为止，在本系列讲座中，我们假设存在图像。我们拍了一张照片
So far in this lecture series, we've assumed the presence of an image. We've taken an image

2
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:12,119
从文件。我们从连接到电脑的相机拍摄了一张照片。我们抓住了一个
from a file. We've taken an image from a camera attached to our computer. We've grabbed an

3
00:00:12,119 --> 00:00:17,410
来自互联网的图像。现在是时候谈谈图像是如何形成的。
image from the Internet. It's time now to talk about how images are actually formed.

4
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:21,829
图像在相机内形成，它们实际上形成在背面的视网膜上
Images are formed within cameras and they are actually formed on the retina at the back

5
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:28,129
我们的眼睛。有一个非常迷人的图像形成方面，我们采取三维
of our eye. There's a really fascinating aspect of image formation, we take the three dimensional

6
00:00:28,129 --> 00:00:32,800
我们生活的世界，这对我们来说非常真实，我们将它投射到两个方面。
world that we live in, that's very real to us and we project it into two dimensions.

7
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:36,940
因此，当我们有一个图像，一张照片或类似的东西时，它是平的，它是唯一的
So when we have an image, a photograph or something like that, it's flat, it's only

8
00:00:36,940 --> 00:00:43,280
二维的。所以我们采取了三维的东西，并将其转化为二维的东西。
two-dimensional. So we've taken three-dimensional things and transformed it into two-dimensional things.

9
00:00:43,460 --> 00:00:47,420
我们只有三个维度，所以我们扔掉了一个，现在我们有两个。
We only had three dimensions to start with, so we've thrown away one, now we've got two.

10
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,659
必须有一些后果。有一些非常有趣的后果
There's got to be some consequence of that. There are some very interesting consequences

11
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:55,900
尝试将三个维度压缩成两个。
of trying to crunch three dimensions down into two.

12
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:59,869
但这还有另一个非常有趣的方面。那就是我看一张照片
But there's another really interesting aspect of this. And that is if I look at a photograph

13
00:00:59,869 --> 00:01:04,990
虽然我知道它是扁平的，但对于我来说它看起来是三维的
of a landscape, it looks three dimensional to me, even though I know it's flat, it's

14
00:01:04,990 --> 00:01:09,580
一张照片，我可以用手抚摸它，它是完全平坦的。所以有一些魔力
a photograph, I can run my hand over it, it is perfectly flat. So there's some magic going

15
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:14,990
在我的脑海里，我正在重建那些实际上并不存在的维度
on in my head, where I'm reconstructing dimensions that don't actually exist and that just comes

16
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:20,640
从我个人对世界三维性质的体验;我的脑子
from my own personal experience of the three dimensional nature of the world; my brain

17
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,860
填补这个额外的维度。
fills in this extra dimension.

18
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:27,720
所以这些是我想在这组中谈论的图像形成的方面
So these are the aspects of image formation that I want to talk about in this group of

19
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,200
三个讲座。在本讲座中，我们将了解如何使用针孔形成图像
three lectures. In this lecture we're going to look out how images are formed using pinhole

20
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,850
带镜头的相机和相机以及本讲座中的处理都是几何的;
cameras and cameras with lenses and the treatment in this lecture is all going to be geometric;

21
00:01:37,850 --> 00:01:42,600
这是关于类似的三角形。我们还将看一些不同类型的相机;
it's about similar triangles. We're also going to look at a few different types of cameras;

22
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:47,770
我们将看看鱼眼摄像机和全景摄像机以及一种非常新型的摄像机
we're going to look at fisheye cameras and panoramic cameras and a very new type of camera

23
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:49,420
称为“光场相机”。
called a "Light Field Camera".
