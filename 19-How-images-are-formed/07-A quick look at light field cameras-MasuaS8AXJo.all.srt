1
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:07,700
在本讲座开始时，我们会考虑为什么如果我拿着一张纸的问题
At the beginning of this lecture, we consider the problem of why if I hold a sheet of paper

2
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:12,769
在场景前面，我在那张纸上看不到图像。原因
up in front of the scene, I do not see an image on that sheet of paper. And the reason

3
00:00:12,769 --> 00:00:18,300
因为我们谈到的是，在论文的任何特定点，我们记录了
for that as we talked about was that at any particular point on the paper, we record the

4
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:23,220
落在那个特定点并且光线来自的总光量
total amount of light that's falling on that particular point and that light has come from

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,990
现实世界中非常非常多的要点。我们记录了那里的总光量。
very, very many points in the real world itself. We've recorded the total amount of light there.

6
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:32,739
我们没有谈到光线来自的方向。
We didn't say anything about the direction that the light rays came from.

7
00:00:32,739 --> 00:00:37,219
那么，如果我们能够在每个点实际记录的不仅仅是光量，而且还有
So, what if we could actually record at each point not just the amount of light but the

8
00:00:37,219 --> 00:00:41,480
光的来源方向？这让我们进入所谓的光之区
direction that the light came from? This gets us into the area of what's called a light

9
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:47,890
领域。现在，一个光场，在数学上，它是一个描述光的功能
field. Now, a light field is, mathematically, it's a function that describes the light that's

10
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,120
在空间的每一个点上向每一个方向行进。
travelling in every single direction at every single point in space.

11
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:56,930
想想你现在所处的房间。考虑其中的任何特定点
Think about the room that you're in at the moment. Consider any particular point in that

12
00:00:56,930 --> 00:01:01,730
房间里会有大量的光线穿过那个点，他们会
room and there'll be a large number of light rays passing through that point and they will

13
00:01:01,730 --> 00:01:05,019
来自房间内的许多其他点。
have come from many many other points within the room.

14
00:01:05,019 --> 00:01:10,680
因此，非常非常复杂的光线，都会向不同的方向发展
So, very, very complex lots of light rays, all going different directions and coming

15
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:12,159
来自不同的地方。
from different places.

16
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:18,729
因此，光场传感器试图捕获其中的一些，以捕获颜色和强度
So, a light field sensor attempts to capture some of that, to capture the color, the intensity

17
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:25,000
和所有这些光线的矢量方向。传统相机简单地加起来
and the vector direction of all these rays of light. Traditional camera simply adds up

18
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,479
所有的光线并记录总和。光场相机尝试记录
all the rays of light and records the sum total. Light field cameras try to record the

19
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:36,619
方向也是方向非常重要。再考虑这个例子
directions as well and the direction is really important. Consider this example again of

20
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:41,259
薄透镜模型。我们在世界上有一个对象。这是一大堆光线
the thin lens model. We have an object in the world. It's a whole bunch of light rays

21
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:46,579
让物体通过镜头并穿过焦平面。
leaving the object passing through the lens and passing through the focal plane.

22
00:01:46,579 --> 00:01:51,520
我在这里展示了一个像素，进入该像素的光线来自
I've shown here a pixel and the light rays that are entering that pixel are coming from

23
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:58,479
大量不同的方向。让我们动画这个，你可以看到那个对象
a large number of different directions. Let’s animate this, you can see that the object

24
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:04,740
正在移动，我们可以看到来自该物体尖端的光线穿过像素阵列。
is moving and we can see the light rays from the tip of that object moving across the array of pixels.

25
00:02:05,540 --> 00:02:10,479
因此，当它真正接近镜头时，它将成为传统的焦点
So, the object when it's really close to the lens would be well out of focus in the traditional

26
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:15,540
相机。然而，正在发生的是那些光线现在正在一个范围内
camera. What's happening though is that those light rays are now following across a range

27
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:20,150
像素和每个像素，这些光线以不同的角度进入。
of pixels and that each pixel, those light rays are entering at a different angle.

28
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:24,670
因此，如果这些像素不仅能够记录光量而且能够记录方向
So, if those pixels were able to record not just the amount of light but the direction

29
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:30,060
他们来自哪里，甚至可以计算图像
at which they are coming from as well, it would be possible to compute the image even

30
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:35,410
虽然它非常非常失焦，但这是一种开始出现的技术
though it is very, very out of focus and this is a technology that's starting to emerge

31
00:02:35,410 --> 00:02:38,500
现在在所谓的光场相机。
now in what's called light field cameras.

32
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:43,580
现在，市场上第一个，消费级别的光场相机，这一个产生
Now, one of the first on the market, the consumer level of light field cameras, this one produced

33
00:02:43,580 --> 00:02:49,620
通过Lytro和本幻灯片的右侧，我们可以看到的是光场
by Lytro and in the right hand side of this slide, what we can see is the light field

34
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:56,370
正在对图像进行后处理以使图像的特定部分成为焦点。所以，这个人
image being post-processed to bring a particular part of the image into focus. So, the person

35
00:02:56,370 --> 00:03:02,069
点击图像中的特定点并使用来自的所有原始信息
is clicking on a particular point in the image and using all the raw information from the

36
00:03:02,069 --> 00:03:09,190
光场，光量及其方向，我们可以计算出适当的焦点图像。
light field, the amount of light and its direction, we can compute the appropriate in focus image.

37
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:14,750
我们不能让图像中的每个点始终聚焦，但我们现在可以选择
We cant let every point in the image in focus at all the time but we can now select after

38
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:20,260
我们拍摄了我们想要关注的部分，这是向前迈出的一大步。
we took the picture which part we would like to have in focus and that's a big step forward.

39
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,590
早期版本的光场相机，其研究版本非常非常
Early versions of light field cameras, the research versions of these were very very

40
00:03:24,590 --> 00:03:30,420
大量的相机，非常昂贵，远非便携式。这是一个例子
massive arrays of cameras, very expensive and far from portable. Here's an example of

41
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:36,409
早期的便携式光场相机。再一次，一系列试图捕捉的相机
an early portable light field camera. Again, an array of cameras, which are trying to capture

42
00:03:36,409 --> 00:03:41,409
来自世界的光线以及它们来自的各个方向。
the light rays coming from the world and the various directions at which they've come from.

43
00:03:41,409 --> 00:03:45,709
这是一项现在的技术，随着手机的成本变得越来越容易获得
This is a technology now, which is becoming quite accessible as the cost of phones is

44
00:03:45,709 --> 00:03:50,640
减少。现在可以创建大量的摄像机和这些视频
being reduced. It's now possible to create enormous arrays of cameras and these videos

45
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,420
展示一些使用商用手机相机，廉价数码相机完成的工作
show some work that's being done using commodity mobile phone cameras, cheap digital cameras

46
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,409
为了能够捕获光场，一旦你有一个捕获的光场，那么，
in order to be able to capture light fields and once you have a captured light field then,

47
00:04:01,409 --> 00:04:07,099
你可以执行一些非常惊人的视觉效果，停止动作效果等。
you can perform some very amazing visual effects, stop motion effects and so on.
