1
00:00:03,460 --> 00:00:09,580
要在二维表面上记录三维场景，需要一些技巧，一些洞察力
To record a three dimensional scene on a two dimensional surface requires some skills, some insight

2
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:15,420
几何学和数学。如果我们看一下那些图纸
into both geometry and mathematics. And if we look at the sorts of drawings that are

3
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,869
由幼儿或我们古代祖先的洞穴壁画完成，很明显
done by young children or the cave paintings of our ancient ancestors, it's clear that

4
00:00:20,869 --> 00:00:26,449
他们没有必要的洞察力。他们所做的图纸非常简单
they didn't have the required insight. The drawings that they do are very simplistic

5
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:29,240
他们并没有真正捕捉到第三个维度。
and they don't really capture the third dimension.

6
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:34,730
事实上，为了达成谅解，人类花了很长时间
In fact, it took humanity quite a long time in order to come up with an understanding

7
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:39,780
怎么做所以这是一幅我从早期文艺复兴时期就非常喜爱的画作
of how to do this. So this is a painting that I love very much from the early renaissance

8
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:46,010
时代，它非常清楚地表明，基础几何数学一直很精彩
era and it shows, very clearly, that the underlying geometry mathematics has been beautifully

9
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:51,320
捕获因为当我们看这幅画时，它毕竟只是二维的，它
captured because when we look at this painting, which is after all only two dimensional, it

10
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:58,190
作为观众激发我们的灵感，一种非常生动的三维感知。
inspires in us as viewers, a very vivid three dimensional perception.

11
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:03,510
为了实现这种现实，我们需要了解基础几何。和
In order to achieve this realism, we need to understand the underlying geometry. And

12
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,580
在这个特殊的图纸中，我们可以看到很多几何构造线
in this particular drawing here, we can see a lot of the geometric construction lines

13
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:14,729
由艺术家设置，以确保最终绘画的几何形状
put in place by the artist, in order to ensure that the geometry of the final painting will

14
00:01:14,729 --> 00:01:16,380
是对的。
be correct.

15
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:22,630
这在法国被提升为一种非常流行的艺术形式，我们在这里看到的是外观
This was elevated to a very popular art form in France and what we see here is what looks

16
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:30,460
像一个乡村景观的图像通过建筑物的墙上的石窗看到。
like an image of a rural landscape viewed through a stone window in the wall of a building.

17
00:01:30,460 --> 00:01:35,729
当然这只是一种幻觉。它是墙上的一幅二维画
Of course this is just an illusion. It is a two-dimensional painting on the wall of

18
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:41,450
一个房子。这是它的现代版本，它的街头艺术版本。这出现了什么
a house. This is a modern version of it, a street art version of it. And what this appears

19
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:47,700
展示是一个通过建筑物的门户，我们可以看到一些着名的纽约
to show is a portal through a building, beyond which we can see some of the famous New York

20
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:53,290
桥梁，但它再次只是一个二维幻觉，但这次非常庞大
bridges, but again it is just a two-dimensional illusion, but this time on a very massive

21
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:54,329
规模。
scale.

22
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:58,469
现在这些幻想非常非常受欢迎，并且有很多人
Now these kinds of illusions are very, very popular and there are a bunch of people who

23
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,600
做美妙的粉笔街头艺术，
do wonderful chalk street art,

24
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:03,750
这些幻想得到了非常生动的三个
and these illusions have got a very vivid three

25
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:04,780
对他们的维度，
dimensionality to them,

26
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:08,840
创造这些作品必须做大量的工作
an enormous amount of work must go into creating these pieces

27
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:12,160
艺术的。你不能想象粉笔涉及多少
of art. you can't image how much chalk is involved in

28
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,940
创建这样的图像。
creating an image like this.

29
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:18,989
但是这里发生的是这些画作都是以这样的方式创作出来的
But what's going on here is these paintings have all been created in such a way that the

30
00:02:18,989 --> 00:02:24,580
在我们眼睛的视网膜上产生的刺激与那种刺激完全相同
stimulus that is generated on the retina of our eyes is exactly the same as the sort of

31
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:29,860
通过观察真实的三维场景产生的刺激。所以这是
stimulus that would be generated by looking at a real three dimensional scene. So it's

32
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:34,980
然后，提供给我们眼睛和大脑视网膜的相同刺激就是解释
the same stimulus that's supplied to the retina of our eye and our brain then is interpreting

33
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:40,420
它以正常的方式解释三维世界。它理解
it in the normal way that it goes about interpreting the three-dimensional world. It understands

34
00:02:40,420 --> 00:02:45,280
关于规模的东西，远处的东西很小而且东西很近
something about scale, that things that are far away are small and things that are close

35
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,660
似乎更大。
appear to be larger.

36
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:51,319
因此，我们在大脑中建立的所有关于三维的知识
So all of the knowledge that we have built up in our brains about the three-dimensional

37
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:58,530
我们实际生活在这个世界，被欺骗用三种方式来解释这种感觉
world that we actually live in, is tricked into interpreting this sensation in a three

38
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,680
维度方式。
dimensional way.

39
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,269
因此，即使原始场景是三维的，我们仍然可以在我们的眼睛和眼睛上玩耍
So even if the original scene is three-dimensional we can still play tricks on our eyes and at

40
00:03:04,269 --> 00:03:09,409
乍一看所有这些图片都有点令人惊讶，然后是我们的理性部分
first glance all of these pictures are somewhat surprising and then the rational part of our

41
00:03:09,409 --> 00:03:14,310
大脑开始发挥并说“不，杯子不能那么大。一定是杯子
brain kicks into play and say's "No, the cup can't be that big. It must be that the cup

42
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:19,879
很近，这个人很远。这不可能是小女孩抱着小人物
is close and the person is far away. It can't be that the little girl is holding tiny people

43
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:22,640
在她的手中。微小的人不存在。
in her hand. Tiny people do not exist.

44
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:28,030
所以一定是他们是远离我们的全尺寸人，而且这个女孩离我们很近。“
So it must be that they're full size people far away and that the girl is close to us."

45
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:33,810
所以最初的反应是令人惊讶的，但是当我们开始推理时，
So the initial reaction is one of surprise but then when we start to reason about it,

46
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:37,980
我们了解这些场景中发生了什么，我觉得玩这个游戏很有趣
we understand what's going on in these scenes and I thought It's be fun to play this game

47
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,980
同样，这里是我的朋友克里斯在我的手指尖上跳舞，但当然克里斯
as well, so here's my friend Chris dancing on the tip of my finger, but of course Chris

48
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:46,629
是一个全人类的人，实际上他比我说话。
is a full size human being, in fact he's talker than I am.
