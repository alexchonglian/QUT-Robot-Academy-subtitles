1
00:00:03,570 --> 00:00:07,950
现在让我们谈谈我们如何将内核实际应用于图像。
Let’s talk now about how we would actually apply the kernel to an image.

2
00:00:07,950 --> 00:00:10,260
我们需要应用的算法是什么？
What is the algorithm that we would need to apply?

3
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:15,349
这就是它的样子;它是指定的输入窗口的总和
And this is what it looks like; it is a summation over the input window which is designated

4
00:00:15,349 --> 00:00:22,560
通过符号W.在求和中，我们有输入图像I和内核K.
by the symbol W. And inside the summation we have the input image I and the kernel K.

5
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:30,419
指数I和J都在-H到+H的值范围内。我们在这里以数学方式写了什么
The indices I and J both range over values from -H to +H. What we have written here mathematically

6
00:00:30,419 --> 00:00:35,360
是二维相关的定义。
is the definition of a two dimensional correlation.

7
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,149
存在称为卷积的相关操作，并且数学地表示2D卷积
There is a related operation called convolution, and 2D convolution is represented mathematically

8
00:00:41,149 --> 00:00:42,149
这条路。
this way.

9
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:46,730
它与我们刚才看到的相关性非常相似;事实上，唯一的区别是
It is very similar to the correlation we just looked at; in fact, the only differences are

10
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,559
这些负面迹象在这里。
these negative signs here.

11
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:51,579
为了相关，他们是积极的迹象。
For correlation they were positive signs.

12
00:00:51,579 --> 00:00:56,100
现在，如果内核是对称的，卷积与相关性相同。
Now convolution is the same as correlation if the kernel is symmetric.

13
00:00:56,100 --> 00:01:00,309
例如，我们刚才看到的高斯核确实是对称的。
The Gaussian kernel we just looked at, for example, is indeed symmetric.

14
00:01:00,309 --> 00:01:05,990
卷积的一个优点是它可以以运算符的形式编写。
An advantage of convolution is that it can be written in operator form.

15
00:01:05,990 --> 00:01:11,720
所以这就是输出图像等于与输入图像卷积的内核
So what this says is the output image is equal to the kernel convolved with the input image

16
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:12,720
一世。
I.

17
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:19,229
因此，圆圈内的十字符号表示卷积的运算。
So the symbol of a cross inside a circle represents the operation of convolution.

18
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:22,540
卷积的一些属性是什么？
What are some of the properties of convolution?

19
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:28,030
好一开始它是可交换的，所以与B卷积的A与用A卷积的B相同。
Well for a start it is commutative, so A convolved with B is the same as B convolved with A.

20
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:33,549
它也是关联的，这是我们将在一些即将发布的幻灯片中使用的属性。
It is also associative and this is a property that we will use in some upcoming slides.

21
00:01:33,549 --> 00:01:35,660
我们说它是分配的。
We say it is distributive.

22
00:01:35,660 --> 00:01:37,390
它也是线性的。
And it is also linear.

23
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:41,490
所以这些是卷积的重要数学属性。
So these are important mathematical properties of convolution.

24
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:45,020
现在，关联性的优势是什么？
Now, what are the advantages of associativity?

25
00:01:45,020 --> 00:01:50,549
好吧，考虑我用高斯卷积图像然后进行卷积的情况
Well consider the case where I convolve an image with a Gaussian and then I convolve

26
00:01:50,549 --> 00:01:51,730
再次使用高斯。
with a Gaussian again.

27
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:56,190
所以，如果你愿意，我可以把它想象成添加一个图像，我通过应用高斯来平滑它
So if you like, I can think of this as adding an image, I smooth it by applying a Gaussian

28
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:00,259
它然后我再次平滑它。
to it and then I smooth it again.

29
00:02:00,259 --> 00:02:06,220
这与使用高斯卷积的内核卷积图像相同
This is the same as convolving the image with a kernel which is the Gaussian convolved with

30
00:02:06,220 --> 00:02:07,520
本身。
itself.

31
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:12,610
并且将高斯与另一高斯卷积在高斯中。
And convolving a Gaussian with another Gaussian results in a Gaussian.

32
00:02:12,610 --> 00:02:18,230
并且结果高斯的标准偏差是标准偏差的函数
And the standard deviation of the result Gaussian is a function of a standard deviation of the

33
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:22,850
两个正在成倍增加的高斯，如左边所示。
two Gaussians that are multiplying, as shown over here on the left.

34
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:27,800
因此，为了用非常大的高斯卷积图像，这需要非常高
So in order to convolve an image with a very large Gaussian which would require a very

35
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:34,270
大内核，它实际上相当于用小高斯多次卷积图像
big kernel, it is actually equivalent to convolving the image with a small Gaussian multiple times

36
00:02:34,270 --> 00:02:35,570
连续。
consecutively.

37
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:38,500
这样做可能有一些计算优势。
And there may be some computational advantages of doing that.
