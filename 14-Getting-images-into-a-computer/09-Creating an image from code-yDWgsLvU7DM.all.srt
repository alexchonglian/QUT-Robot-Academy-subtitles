1
00:00:03,730 --> 00:00:09,219
我们已经谈了很多关于图像如何在MATLAB中表示为矩阵的讨论。
We have talked quite a bit about how an image is represented as a matrix inside a MATLAB.

2
00:00:09,219 --> 00:00:15,570
相反，我们使用MATLAB工具创建的矩阵可以显示为图像。
Conversely, a matrix that we create using MATLAB tools can be displayed as an image.

3
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:21,460
所以我们现在要做的是使用一些MATLAB的基本图像创建工具
So what we are going to do now is use some of MATLAB’s fundamental image creation tools

4
00:00:21,460 --> 00:00:27,890
产生一些测试图像。所以我们将纯粹通过代码创建一个新的图像。
to produce some test images. So we are going to create a new image purely through code.

5
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:33,480
因此，让我们首先分配一个工作空间变量im，即我的图像标准名称。
So let’s start off by assigning to a workspace variable im, my standard name for an image.

6
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:38,710
我将使用函数零。它的作用是创建一个具有维度的矩阵
I am going to use the function zeros. And what that does is create a matrix with dimensions

7
00:00:38,710 --> 00:00:45,309
200乘200，该矩阵中的所有元素都是零。我要设置一个元素
200 by 200 and all the elements in that matrix are zeroes. And I am going to set one element

8
00:00:45,309 --> 00:00:51,690
它的值为1.现在我可以显示我刚创建的图像矩阵
of that to the value of 1. Now I can display this matrix that I just created as an image

9
00:00:51,690 --> 00:00:57,390
我们可以看到的是这很大程度上是黑色的，因为所有的像素都是零，这代表了
and what we can see is this largely black, because all the pixels are zero, which represents

10
00:00:57,390 --> 00:01:03,460
在最左上角的黑色和上方，你可以看到一小块白色。那
black and up in the top left-most corner you can see a tiny little patch of white. That

11
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:08,600
是我设置的值为1-1的一个像素，表示白色。
is the one pixel that I set to the value of 1—1 representing white.

12
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:15,330
现在，我可以在这里创建一个稍大的对象，我将要做的是内部
Now, I can create a slightly bigger object in this and what I am going to do is, within

13
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:24,900
这个矩阵，我将设置从第150行到第160行的所有像素，以及所有列
this matrix, I am going to set all the pixels from row 150 to row 160, and all the columns

14
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:32,610
从第60列到第70列，我将把它们设置为0.5。就是这样
from column 60 to column 70, and I am going to set those to a value of 0.5. So that is

15
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:37,970
黑色和白色之间的灰色。我将设置所有这些元素
a grey, half way between black and white. And I am going to set all those elements of

16
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:45,180
矩阵的值为0.5，现在我可以再次显示该矩阵，我们看到了
the matrix to the value of 0.5, now I can display that matrix again and we see we have

17
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:51,690
在图像中创建了一个小灰色方块。所以我们只是通过写作来创建一个图像
created a small grey square in the image. So we are creating an image simply by writing

18
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:54,970
码。工具箱包含要创建的功能
code. The toolbox contains a function to create

19
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:59,290
界。我打算这样做，我打算调用circle函数，它被调用
circles. I am going to do that, I am going to call the circle function, it is called

20
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:05,420
kcircle。而且我要说我想要一个半径为30的圆-我们看到它已经创建了
kcircle. And I am going to say I want a circle of radius 30—we see that it has created

21
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:10,700
尺寸为61乘61的矩阵。让我们来看看我们刚刚创建的这个东西。
a matrix of dimensions 61 by 61. Let’s have a look at this thing that we just created.

22
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:16,930
我们在这里可以看到该矩阵的图像表示。我们可以使用idisp来探索它，
We can see here is the image representation of that matrix. We can explore it using idisp,

23
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:21,299
我们看到这里的所有像素，这些矩阵元素的值都是
and we see that all these pixels in here, these matrix elements, have got a value of

24
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:25,530
所有这些不在圆圈中的值都是0。
1. And all these ones which don’t lie in the circle have got a value of 0.

25
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:31,010
所以这个函数返回了一个方形的矩阵，其中的元素也是
So this function has returned a matrix which is square and the elements in that are either

26
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:36,249
如果它们不属于圆圈，则为0;如果它们属于圆圈，则为白色。
0 if they don’t belong inside the circle and white if they do belong inside the circle.

27
00:02:36,249 --> 00:02:42,140
现在我们现在可以做的是将这个圆圈粘贴到我们之前的图像中，
Now what we can do now is actually paste this circle into the image that we had before,

28
00:02:42,140 --> 00:02:45,560
所以，让我们回到刚才的形象。
so let’s just go back to the image that we had a moment ago.

29
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:56,819
我要将圆圈粘贴到该图像中，我这样做。我要去
And I am going to paste the circle into that image and I do it like this. I am going to

30
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:03,120
制作圆圈，而不是明亮的白色，我会使它变得稍微亮一点灰色
make the circle, not bright white, I am going to make it a slightly brighter grey then the

31
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:08,099
广场是。所以我将乘以圆圈中的所有元素
square was. So I am going to multiply all of the elements in the circle by the value

32
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:13,959
为0.7，因此它将具有70％的灰度值。而我将用它来圈出圆圈
of 0.7, so it will have a 70% grey value. And I am going to place the circle with its

33
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:21,819
因此，这是100和100的u坐标
centre at 100 by 30. So that is the u coordinate of a 100 and the

34
00:03:21,819 --> 00:03:26,670
v坐标30.我现在所做的就是更新元素
v coordinate of 30. All I have done now is updated the elements

35
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:32,450
在矩阵中。我之前拥有的价值，现在它已经粘贴了一个圆圈。
in the matrix im. The value that I had before and now it has got a circle pasted into it.

36
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:37,150
那么让我们来看看。
So let’s have a look at that.

37
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:46,299
我们看到图像现在包含一个正方形和一个圆圈。Toolbox还有其他一些功能
And we see that the image now contains a square and a circle. Toolbox has got some other functions

38
00:03:46,299 --> 00:03:53,790
用于在矩阵内创建图形实体。另一个功能是iline，并绘制了一个
for creating graphical entities within a matrix. Another function is iline and that draws a

39
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:58,779
行成矩阵。所以我要在matixim中划一条线。
line into a matrix. So I am going to draw a line into the matix im.

40
00:03:58,779 --> 00:04:06,480
该线将从坐标30开始40，并且它将在190到190之间，
The line is going to start at coordinate 30 by 40. And it is going to go to 150 by 190,

41
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:12,209
我将使它的值为90％灰色。
and I’m going to make it have a value of 90% grey.

42
00:04:12,209 --> 00:04:20,260
让我们看一下。我们有一个矩阵，现在包含一个正方形，一条线，
Let’s display that. And there we have a matrix which now contains a square, a line,

43
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:27,000
一个圆圈和一个明亮的像素。Toolbox有一些功能可以轻微创建
a circle and a single bright pixel. Toolbox has got some functions to create slightly

44
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,040
更精细的测试模式，通过测试模式功能访问。在这里，我要去
more elaborate test patterns, accessed through the test pattern function. And here I am going

45
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:40,180
创建一个斜坡函数，我将创建一个尺寸为200乘200像素的图像。
to create a ramp function and I am going to create an image of dimensions 200 by 200 pixels.

46
00:04:40,180 --> 00:04:48,380
让我们来看看。在这里，我们有一个所谓的灰度
And let’s have a look at that. And here we have what is called a grey scale

47
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:53,210
坡道。我们来看看这里的灰度值。它们相当低
ramp. Let’s have a look at the grey scale values in here. They are quite low, about

48
00:04:53,210 --> 00:04:57,670
0.5，当我们水平移动时，它会变得更亮更明亮
0.5 and as we move horizontally it gets brighter and brighter all the way up

49
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:02,950
因此，如果它是灰度斜坡模式，我们可以创建更精细的测试模式
to 1. So if it is a grey scale ramp pattern we can create more elaborate test patterns

50
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:08,900
例如正方形或圆形网格。这是一个例子。我们将它分配给输出
such as grid of squares or circles. Here is an example. We assign it to an output

51
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:16,070
变量im，使用测试模式函数。要求正方形。我们想要输出图像
variable im, use the test pattern function. Ask for squares. We want the output image

52
00:05:16,070 --> 00:05:23,460
为200像素乘200像素。我们希望正方形的间距为50像素
to be 200 pixels by 200 pixels. We want the squares to be on a 50 pixel spacing and we

53
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:33,780
希望方块是25像素的正方形。让我们显示那个图像。我们有一个16格的网格。
want the squares to be 25 pixels square. Let’s display that image. And there we have a grid of 16 squares.
