1
00:00:03,409 --> 00:00:08,459
我们刚刚看到了如何将存储在计算机上的文件中的图像加载到MATLAB中
We have just seen how we can load images from files stored on our computer into the MATLAB

2
00:00:08,459 --> 00:00:13,910
我们可以开始观察它们并操纵它们的环境，但对于机器人来说
environment where we can begin to look at them and manipulate them, but for a robot

3
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:18,930
它正如现在一样感知世界，这一点非常重要。所以那些信息
it is really important that it is sensing the world as it is now. So information that

4
00:00:18,930 --> 00:00:23,900
存储在文件中可能不是最新的。我们需要把世界看作它
is stored in a file may not be sufficiently up to date. We need to see the world as it

5
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:28,160
现在是：我们需要能够从相机中提取图像。
is now: we need to be able to bring images in from a camera.

6
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:34,220
现在很幸运的是，几乎所有的计算机都连接了一个或多个摄像头
Now it is really fortunate today that almost all computers have one or more cameras attached

7
00:00:34,220 --> 00:00:38,809
给他们。所以我们现在要看的是我们如何从相机获取信息
to them. So what we are going to look at now is how we get information from a camera on

8
00:00:38,809 --> 00:00:46,050
我的电脑进入MATLAB环境。所以我们在MATLAB桌面工作区
my computer into the MATLAB environment. So here we are in the MATLAB desktop workspace

9
00:00:46,050 --> 00:00:51,480
再次，为了从相机中抓取图像，我们首先创建一个对象，一个MATLAB
again and in order to grab an image from a camera we first create an object, a MATLAB

10
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:57,469
连接到相机的物体，在这种情况下，它是第0相机
object that is attached to the camera and in this case, it is the zeroth camera—that

11
00:00:57,469 --> 00:01:04,339
是我的电脑第一台相机。它在MATLAB中创建了一个新对象
is the first camera that my computer has. And it creates a new object in the MATLAB

12
00:01:04,339 --> 00:01:09,521
workspace，VideoCamera类型的对象。一旦创建了这个对象，就可以了
workspace, an object of type VideoCamera. As soon as this object has been created, the

13
00:01:09,521 --> 00:01:13,580
连接到我电脑的相机已经上线了;一点点红色的记录灯来了
camera attached to my computer has become live; a little red recording light has come

14
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:18,380
上。该对象支持许多方法，并且是我们目的最重要的方法
on. This object supports a number of methods, and the most important method for our purposes

15
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:22,831
是抓取方法，从相机抓取图像，最近的图像来自
is the grab method, which grabs an image from the camera, the most recent image from the

16
00:01:22,831 --> 00:01:28,400
相机，并显示它。我们可能对实际推杆感兴趣
camera, and displays it. We might be interested in actually putting

17
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:33,850
将图像转换为工作空间变量，我们就是这样做的。我们分配输出
the image into a workspace variable and we do it in this way. We assign the output of

18
00:01:33,850 --> 00:01:39,040
工作空间变量的抓取方法，在这种情况下，变量im和图像
the grab method to a workspace variable and in this case, the variable im, and the image

19
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,080
从相机中抓取并放入该工作空间变量中。如果我调用该函数
is grabbed from the camera and placed into that workspace variable. If I call the function

20
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:50,979
再次它将拍摄另一张照片并以不同的姿势显示它。
again it will take another picture and display it with my head in a different pose.

21
00:01:50,979 --> 00:01:57,229
相机正在连续运行。为了关闭相机，我需要销毁
The camera is running continuously. In order to turn the camera off I need to destroy the

22
00:01:57,229 --> 00:02:01,560
相机对象。你可以使用MATLABclear命令执行此操作，因此如果我从中清除对象
camera object. You do that with a MATLAB clear command, so if I clear the object from the

23
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:06,389
工作空间对象被破坏，相机关闭。红灯消失。
workspace the object is destroyed and the camera is turned off. The red light disappears.
