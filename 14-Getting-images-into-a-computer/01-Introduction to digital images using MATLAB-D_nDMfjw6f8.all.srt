1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,340
在本讲座中，我们将了解如何将数字图像输入计算机。
In this lecture we're going to learn about how we get a digital image into a computer.

2
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:11,869
对于机器人视觉，这是必不可少的第一步;我们必须有视觉信息
For robotic vision, this is the essential first step; we have to have the visual information

3
00:00:11,869 --> 00:00:16,750
在计算机内部，以便我们可以操纵它并最终从中提取意义，
inside the computer, so that we can manipulate it and eventually extract meaning from it,

4
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:18,810
所以这是必不可少的第一步。
so this is the essential first step.

5
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,930
今天的数字图像非常普遍，它们无处不在。通过数十亿和数十亿美元
Digital images today are really common, they're everywhere. Through billions and billions

6
00:00:23,930 --> 00:00:28,730
Facebook和Flickr上的图像，并通过Instagram等应用程序共享。那里
of images on Facebook and Flickr and shared through applications like Instagram. There

7
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:33,039
数字图像如今如此普遍的几个原因。
are a few reasons why digital images are so common today.

8
00:00:33,039 --> 00:00:37,770
首先是相机无处不在，所以拍照的机会是巨大的。
The first is that cameras are everywhere so the opportunities to take pictures are enormous.

9
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:43,829
我们的手机，平板电脑，笔记本电脑都有相机。大量的
We have cameras in our phones, in our tablet computers, in our laptops. A large number

10
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:47,550
人们现在开始在他们的头上戴着相机拍摄所有的东西
of people are now starting to wear cameras on their heads photographing everything that

11
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:54,010
他们正在看到和体验，或许是24乘7。第二个原因是存储有
they're seeing and experiencing, 24 by 7 perhaps. The second reason why is that storage has

12
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:59,670
变得如此便宜。我们的手机和笔记本电脑中的低成本闪存
become so cheap. Low cost flash memory in our phones and in our laptop computers and

13
00:00:59,670 --> 00:01:05,330
今天你可以用相对较少的钱购买数TB的硬盘存储空间。它
terabytes of hard disk storage that you can buy for relatively little money today. It

14
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:11,280
并不总是这样。十年前，我们正在从化学转向数字化
wasn't always this way. Ten years ago we were making the transition from chemistry to digital

15
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:13,439
拍照技术。
technology for picture taking.

16
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:19,990
在化学成像的旧时代，我们不得不在我们的电影中曝光一些画面;
In the bad old days of chemical imaging, we had to expose a number of frames on our film;

17
00:01:19,990 --> 00:01:24,530
我们永远无法删除图像。一旦电影充满，我们就把它带到商店，我们会得到
we could never delete an image. Once the film was full, we'd take it to the shop, we'd get

18
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:30,399
它开发了，我们将我们的照片重新写在纸上。它的灵活性较低。所以呢
it developed and we'd get our pictures back on paper. It was way less flexible. So what

19
00:01:30,399 --> 00:01:36,320
我们在这个讲座中要做的就是解决我们如何从许多人那里获取图像，
we're going to do in this lecture is work out and discuss how we get images from many,

20
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:42,049
许多数字源，可能来自您的照片库的图像，也许来自网络摄像头
many digital sources, images from perhaps your photo library, perhaps from the web camera

21
00:01:42,049 --> 00:01:48,049
在您的计算机上，也许是从网络上获取这些图像到一个环境中
on your computer, perhaps from the web and getting those images into an environment where

22
00:01:48,049 --> 00:01:49,909
我们可以开始操纵它们了。
we can begin to manipulate them.
