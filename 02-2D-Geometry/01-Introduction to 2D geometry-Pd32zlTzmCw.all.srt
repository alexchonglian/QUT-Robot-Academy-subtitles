1
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:07,670
在这个讲座中，我们想谈谈我们如何描述事物的位置
In this lecture, we want to talk about how we describe the position of things in the

2
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:10,620
世界。在机器人技术中，这非常非常重要。
world. In robotics, this is really, really important.

3
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,110
例如，在我们的机器人问题中，我们可能想要描述机器人的位置。
For instance, in our robotics problem, we might want to describe the position of a robot.

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:19,650
我们可能还想描述机器人想要互动的东西的位置
We might also want to describe the position of something that the robot wants to interact

5
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:24,210
用。例如，它可能想与我的水瓶互动。所以我需要描述一下
with. For instance, it might want to interact with my water bottle. So I need to describe

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:27,950
机器人的位置，水瓶的位置，我也很感兴趣
the position of the robot, the position of the water bottle and I’m also interested

7
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:30,260
在描述相对位置。
in describing the relative position.

8
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,860
水瓶相对于机器人在哪里？这显然是那样的
Where is the water bottle with respect to the robot? And that's clearly something that

9
00:00:33,860 --> 00:00:39,330
机器人想知道它是否想要拿起水瓶。
the robot would like to know if it wanted to go and pick up the water bottle.

10
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:44,860
在描述事物的位置时，我们需要某种参考框架。
When it comes to describing the position of things, we need some kind of frame of reference.

11
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:50,350
这是描述世界事物地位的一个非常重要的方面。这里
This is a pretty important aspect of describing the position of things in the world. Here

12
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:54,040
是我们世界的图景。当然，我们需要牢记的一件事是
is a picture of our world. And one of the things we need to keep in mind of course is

13
00:00:54,040 --> 00:00:58,930
我们的世界，我们世界的表面正在移动。地球表面上的一个点
that our world, the surface of our world is moving. A point on the surface at the earth

14
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:06,860
-赤道在太空中每秒移动近500米。地球本身在移动
– the equator is moving nearly 500 meters per second in space. The earth itself is moving

15
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:12,180
在太阳周围相当高的速度。然后我们的太阳系正在高速运转
at quite a high speed around the sun. And then our solar system is moving at very high

16
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:18,020
绕着银河系中心的速度。而且银河系本身正在以令人难以置信的方式发展
speed around the centre of the galaxy. And the galaxy itself is moving at incredible

17
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:22,610
朝着狮子座的速度迈进。所以，一切都在运转。
speed towards the constellation Leo. So, everything is in motion.

18
00:01:22,610 --> 00:01:27,610
如果我们试图描述事物的位置，那么我们考虑这个问题非常重要
If we're trying to describe where things are, it's really important that we consider the

19
00:01:27,610 --> 00:01:29,470
参照系。
frame of reference.

20
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,310
一切都在发展，所以我们只需要有效地放在地上并说，
Everything is moving so we just have to put effectively a stake in the ground and say,

21
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:39,150
“这是参考点，我们将决定与该参考相关的所有位置
"This is the reference point and we'll decide all positions with respect to that reference

22
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:42,880
“这正是我们所做的。我们将把利益放在地上。例如，
point". That's exactly what we do. We're going to put a stake in the ground. For instance,

23
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,700
就像这个标志贴在这里并说，“这是原点。这是坐标，零零
like this sign post here and say, "This is the origin. This is the coordinate, zero zero

24
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:50,800
我们将测量距离的所有距离。
and we're going to measure all distances from that.

25
00:01:50,800 --> 00:01:55,909
我们将创建一个坐标系。有效地是两个正交轴。一个x轴，
And we're going to create a coordinate frame. Effectively two orthogonal axes. An x-axis,

26
00:01:55,909 --> 00:02:00,530
和y轴，你在学校学到的各种东西。我们将使用这两个
and a y-axis, sorts of things that you learn at school. And we're going to use those two

27
00:02:00,530 --> 00:02:06,319
距离，沿x轴的距离，沿y轴的距离，以便描述
distances, the distance along the x-axis, the distance along the y-axis, in order to describe

28
00:02:06,319 --> 00:02:09,990
二维空间中物体的位置。
the position of an object in two-dimensional space.

29
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:13,760
在这个讲座中，我们将保持简单。我们只会考虑这个位置
In this lecture, we're going to keep things simple. We're only going to consider the position

30
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,790
在两个方面。在下一个讲座中，我会提出一个问题并谈谈立场
in two dimensions. In the next lecture, I will kick it up a notch and talk about position

31
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:21,870
三维。
in 3 dimensions.

32
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:28,360
现在，参考点完全是任意的。那么，我们来谈谈这个参考
Now, reference points are entirely arbitrary. So, let's talk for a moment about the reference

33
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:33,960
我们在自己的星球上使用的系统。所以，在这里我们描绘了行星地球。
system that we use on our own planet. So, here we have a depiction of planet earth.

34
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:38,100
这是一个投射，地球当然是一个球体。并制作一张矩形地图
And this is a projection, the earth of course is a sphere. And to make a rectangular map

35
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:42,450
像这样我们要做的就是切割球体，展开它，伸展它以使它看起来
like this what we have to do is cut the sphere, unroll it, stretch it out so that it looks

36
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:48,930
像一个矩形。我们在地球上添加了几条参考线。最重要的一个，
like a rectangle. And we put a couple of reference lines on our globe. The most important one,

37
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:51,480
也许最明显的一个是赤道。
perhaps the most obvious one, is the equator.

38
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,260
因为地球是一个球体，我们有一个明显的轴，就是行星的轴
Because the earth is a sphere, we have an obvious axis which is that which the planet

39
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:01,890
转过来。并且您可以创建与该旋转轴正交的平面
rotates around. And you may create a plane orthogonal to this rotational axis that cuts

40
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:06,910
将球体分成两个相等的半球，我们称这条线为赤道并显示出来
the sphere into two equal hemispheres, and we call that line the equator and it shown

41
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:10,900
这里是黑色的。当你可以站在你的腿上时，你可以去参观赤道
here in black. And you can go and visit the equator when you can stand with your leg one

42
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:15,270
在北半球和南半球。
in the Northern Hemisphere and one in the Southern Hemisphere.

43
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:20,849
现在有另一条线，我们称之为Prime子午线并且它正交于
Now there's another line, which we call the Prime meridian and it passes orthogonal to

44
00:03:20,849 --> 00:03:25,160
赤道，它穿过伦敦的格林威治天文台。
the equator, and it passes through the Greenwich observatory in London.

45
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:29,770
这条线是完全随意的。它不一定要通过格林威治天文台
This line is completely arbitrary. It doesn't have to be through the Greenwich observatory

46
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:35,099
但我们星球上的惯例是我们使用格林威治天文台线
but the convention on our planet is that we used the Greenwich observatory line as

47
00:03:35,099 --> 00:03:40,030
Prime经络，你可以去格林威治，你可以把双脚放在两边
the Prime meridian, and you can go visit Greenwich you can put your feet on either side

48
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:47,250
西方的本初子午线和地球的东半球。
of the Prime meridian in the West and the Eastern Hemispheres of the planet.

49
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:53,850
水平方向上的距离，我们称为经度。和方向，
The distance in the horizontal direction, we refer to as longitude. And the direction,

50
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:58,610
在另一个方向上的距离，我们称为纬度。所以我们有经度线
the distance in the other direction, we refer to as latitude. So we have lines of longitude

51
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:03,790
和我们在球体上刻上的纬度线。那两个数字，经度
and lines of latitude that we inscribe onto the sphere. And those two numbers, longitude

52
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:09,640
和纬度，足以描述任何点，表面上任何地方的位置
and latitude, are sufficient to describe the position of any point, any place on the surface

53
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,570
我们的星球。
of our planet.

54
00:04:11,570 --> 00:04:16,720
现在，正如我之前提到的那样，我们称之为Prime子午线
Now, we have this arbitrary line as I've mentioned before which we called the Prime meridian

55
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,099
穿过格林威治天文台。如果历史不同，我们就会有
which goes through the Greenwich observatory. If history had been different, we would have

56
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:26,509
有一个不同的Prime子午线。有一个关于Prime经络的建议要通过
had a different Prime meridian. There was a proposal for the Prime meridian to go through

57
00:04:26,509 --> 00:04:31,409
巴黎天文台。如果你今天访问巴黎，你可以看到一条被称为
the Paris observatory. And if you visit Paris today, you can see a line referred to as the

58
00:04:31,409 --> 00:04:38,410
Arago线是这个不存在的Prime子午线穿过城市的地方
Arago line which is where this non-existent Prime meridian passes through the city of

59
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:44,050
巴黎。它以法国天文学家和数学家阿拉戈（Arago）的名字命名
Paris. And it's named after a French astronomer and mathematician, Arago, who proposed that

60
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,409
特别是本初子午线。
particular Prime meridian.

61
00:04:45,409 --> 00:04:50,310
所以，这里的带回家信息是这个Prime子午线完全是任意的。它
So, the take home message here is that this Prime meridian is completely arbitrary. It

62
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:55,629
是一个我们都同意的公约。有这个约定是有用的
is a convention that we've all agreed upon. It's useful to have this convention and that's

63
00:04:55,629 --> 00:04:58,679
我们如何描述地球上的点。
how we describe points on the planet of the earth.
