00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:09,520
现在是时候开始使这些概念真实。这是什么？这封信是什么？
Now it's time to start making these concepts real. What is this thing? What is this letter ksi?

2
00:00:10,060 --> 00:00:14,480
我们将通过分离旋转和翻译来做到这一点。
We're going to do this by separating rotation and translation.

3
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,390
在这里，我们有两种不同姿势的汽车。我们可以用术语来描述第二个姿势
Here we have the car at two different poses. And we can describe the second pose in terms

4
00:00:19,390 --> 00:00:27,609
从这里到那里的相对姿势。现在为了帮助我们理解和发展
of a relative pose from here to there. Now in order to aid our understanding and development

5
00:00:27,609 --> 00:00:34,160
这个概念，我们将把它分成两部分。翻译后跟着
of the concept, we're going to split this into two parts. A translation followed by

6
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,730
轮换。我们首先要处理旋转部件，因为它实际上更复杂
a rotation. We're going to deal with the rotational part first because it's actually more complex

7
00:00:39,730 --> 00:00:43,859
比翻译和概念上更难理解。
than translation and conceptually more difficult to understand.
