1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,759
最常见的几何类型称为欧几里德几何，它的名字命名为
The most common type of Geometry is known as Euclidean Geometry and it’s named after

2
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:13,119
亚历山大的Euclid和他是希腊人，很久以前就住在埃及。
Euclid of Alexandria and he was a Greek who lived a long time ago in Egypt.

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,159
公元前300年左右，他写了一本非常非常着名的书。实际上，一套13本书。它被称为The
Around 300 BC, he wrote a very, very famous book. In fact, a set of 13 books. It was called The

4
00:00:20,159 --> 00:00:25,400
元素。而且，这是你在学校时学到的几何学的基础。
Elements. And, this is the basis of the Geometry that you learned when you were at school.

5
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:31,009
它是平面中物体的几何形状和三维空间中的物体。它的
It’s the Geometry of things in a plane and of things in three-dimensional space. It’s

6
00:00:31,009 --> 00:00:37,809
关于线条，三角形和圆形的几何图形。如果你愿意的话，它基于一些公理
Geometry about lines and triangles and circles. It’s based on a few axioms, if you like

7
00:00:37,809 --> 00:00:43,309
基本原则。而且，从这几个公理，所有其他原则
fundamental underlying principles. And, from these few axioms, all the other principles

8
00:00:43,309 --> 00:00:50,870
可以导出几何。重要的是，欧几里德几何中没有数字。我们有
of Geometry can be derived. Importantly, there are no numbers in Euclidean Geometry. We have

9
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:55,749
线。我们有来信。我们谈论平行线，我们谈论直角，但是
lines. We have letters. We talk about parallel lines and we talk about right angles, but

10
00:00:55,749 --> 00:01:01,390
欧几里德几何中没有数字，也没有坐标框架。
there are no numbers in Euclidean Geometry and there are no coordinate frames either.

11
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:07,300
勒内·笛卡尔（ReneDescartes）是17世纪非常着名的思想家。他是一位哲学家。
Rene Descartes was a very, very famous thinker in the 17th Century. He was a philosopher.

12
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:12,800
他是一名数学家，在他年轻的时候甚至是兼职雇佣兵。他是
He was a mathematician and he was even a part time mercenary in his younger days. He’s

13
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:17,050
他经常被称为现代哲学之父，他特别出名
often referred to as the Father of Modern Philosophy and he was particularly famous

14
00:01:17,050 --> 00:01:23,500
对于这句话的原始拉丁语的翻译，“我想，因此我是。”
for the translation from the original Latin of this quote, “I think, therefore I am.”

15
00:01:23,500 --> 00:01:28,450
关于笛卡尔的生活有很多故事。我特别喜欢的是
There are many stories about Descartes’ life. One that I particularly like is the

16
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:33,190
事实上，他发现整个上午躺在床上非常非常有用
fact that he found that was very, very useful to lay in bed all through the morning and

17
00:01:33,190 --> 00:01:37,730
认为。这是他的思考时间。而且，这是一个非常好的原则。
think. It was his thinking time. And, it’s a really great principle.

18
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:42,070
一天早上，他躺在床上，看着墙壁，一只苍蝇进来了，它降落了
One morning, he was lying in bed, looking at the wall, and a fly came in, and it landed

19
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:46,300
在墙壁上。并且，他意识到他将能够描述苍蝇的位置
on the wall. And, he realized that he would be able to describe the position of the fly

20
00:01:46,300 --> 00:01:51,100
仅仅是两个数字。因此，无论苍蝇在墙上的哪个地方，都可以进行描述
simply in terms of two numbers. So wherever the fly was on the wall, it could be described

21
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:56,930
非常简洁地使用两个数字。而且，这是笛卡尔坐标的基础
very succinctly using just two numbers. And, this is the basis of the Cartesian coordinate

22
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:02,310
框架，我们用两个坐标，两个数字表示平面中某物的位置。
frame where we represent the position of something in the plane using two coordinates, two numbers.

23
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:07,780
因此，笛卡尔所做的非常重要的事情是他将代数添加到欧几里德几何中。
So, the very important thing that Descartes did was he added Algebra to Euclidean Geometry.

24
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:13,450
而且，这使我们可以用方程表达形状。我们可以表达线条
And, that allowed us then to express shapes in terms of equations. We can express lines

25
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:18,060
在等式方面。我们有两条线的方程。我们可以弄清楚它们是如何相交的
in terms of equation. We have the equations for two lines. We can work out how they intersect

26
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,270
和它们相交的角度。它是代数与古代几何的融合。
and what angle they intersect. It’s the fusion of Algebra with the ancient Geometry.

27
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:28,840
我们将其称为笛卡尔几何或解析几何。它被称为笛卡儿。
We refer to this as Cartesian Geometry or Analytic Geometry. It’s called Cartesian.

28
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,720
这源于他在拉丁语中的名字Cartesius。所以，他就是那个发达的人
That’s derived from his name in Latin which was Cartesius. So, he is the one who developed

29
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,970
坐标系，这是我们今天非常非常熟悉的概念，但它可以追溯到
the coordinate system, a very, very familiar concept to us today, but it dates back to

30
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:48,420
只有17世纪。那么，让我们看一下2D坐标系。我们有一对轴。
only the 17th Century. So, let’s look at a 2D coordinate frame. We have a pair of axes.

31
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,870
这些中的每一个都是一个实数行，它们在我们称之为的点相交
Each of these is a real number line and they intersect at a point that we refer to as the

32
00:02:53,870 --> 00:03:00,569
起源。因此，两个轴形成2D坐标系，x轴和y轴。现在，我们来吧
origin. So, two axes form a 2D coordinate frame, an x-axis and a y-axis. Now, let’s

33
00:03:00,569 --> 00:03:05,300
用这个二维坐标系描述一个点。为了做到这一点，我们
describe a point using this two-dimensional coordinate frame. In order to do that, we

34
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:10,660
将一条线向下放到x轴，它与原点的距离由数量引用
drop a line down to the x-axis and its distance from the origin we refer to by the quantity

35
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:15,620
一个。并且，我们将另一条线移到y轴和沿y轴的距离
a. And, we drop another line across to the y-axis and the distance along the y-axis from

36
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:20,390
原点我们称之为距离b。因此，可以非常简洁地描述P点
the origin we refer to as the distance b. So, the point P can be described very succinctly

37
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:24,550
使用一对数字，我们将它们写在括号中就像那样。
using a pair of numbers and we write them in brackets just like that.

38
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:29,840
数学家会说一个点是n维空间中的一个位置。我们会
A mathematician would say that a point is a location in an n-dimensional space. We would

39
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:36,020
说P点是实数的一个元素，或者属于一个实数的一个元素
say that the point P is an element of, or belongs to, the set of real numbers to the power of

40
00:03:36,020 --> 00:03:41,890
ñ。在这种情况下，它将是R平方。我们可以用笛卡尔坐标表示这一点。
n. In this case, it would be R squared. We can represent the point by a Cartesian coordinate.

41
00:03:41,890 --> 00:03:46,670
我们也可以将它称为n元组。这是一组n个数字。我们给他们编号
We can also refer to it as an n-tuple. That’s a group of n numbers. We number them from

42
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:52,840
x1，x2，一直到xn。同样，在简单的二维情况下，n简单地相等
x1, x2, all the way up to xn. Again, in the simple two-dimensional case, n is simply equal

43
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:57,599
我们可以将矢量视为从坐标系原点到箭头的箭头
to 2. We can think of a vector as an arrow from the origin of our coordinate frame to

44
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:04,500
兴趣点。并且，我们用小写字母表示向量。按大写分
the point of interest. And, we denote vectors by lower case letters. Points by upper case

45
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:08,890
字母，小写字母矢量。在这种情况下，小写p。
letters, vectors by lower case letters. In this case, lower case p.

46
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:14,580
向量有两个组件。长度为a的水平分量和垂直分量
A vector has got two components. A horizontal component of length a, and a vertical component

47
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:19,859
长度b。我们写矢量p与我们写点P的方式不同。我们写
of length b. We write the vector p differently to the way we write the point P. We write

48
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,490
它作为一个矢量。这是一堆数字，一个在另一个之上。在这种情况下，一个以上
it as a vector. That’s a stack of numbers, one above the other. In this case, a above

49
00:04:24,490 --> 00:04:29,770
湾所以，它是一个双元素向量。它也与2×1矩阵相同。
b. So, it’s a two element vector. It’s also the same as a 2 by 1 matrix.

50
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:33,010
这是一个有两行一列的矩阵。
That’s a matrix with two rows and one column.

51
00:04:33,010 --> 00:04:36,330
数学家会说矢量是一个元素
A mathematician would say that a vector is an element of an

52
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:41,830
n维向量空间，我们写下，因为小写p是元素或属于
n-dimensional vector space and we'd write that as lower case p is an element of or belongs

53
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:47,749
到n的幂的实数集合。再次，在这个简单的情况下，n是相等的
to the set of real numbers to the power of n. Once again, in this simple case, n is equal

54
00:04:47,749 --> 00:04:52,620
到2，因为它是一个二维坐标系。我们可以代表我们的向量，我们的箭头
to 2 because it’s a two-dimensional coordinate frame. We can represent our vector, our arrow

55
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:57,659
在坐标系上，作为数学n向量，具有两个元素的向量。和
on the coordinate frame, as a mathematical n vector, a vector with two elements. And

56
00:04:57,659 --> 00:05:03,669
所以，这是元素x1，x2，一直到xn，我们应用转置运算符。
so, that’s the elements x1, x2, all the way up to xn and we apply the transpose operator.

57
00:05:03,669 --> 00:05:09,909
在这里，我把矢量写成行向量。元素水平地彼此相邻。
Here, I’ve written the vector as a row vector. The elements are next to each other horizontally.

58
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:14,650
当我转置它时，它变成一个列向量，元素一个在另一个之上，并且这个
When I transpose it, it becomes a column vector, the elements one above the other, and this

59
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:19,319
当我们开始将矩阵和向量相乘时，它将变得很重要。
will become important later, when we start to multiply matrices and vectors together.

60
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:24,759
我们还可以认为向量是相对位移。它谈到一项动议。怎么样
We can also consider that a vector is a relative displacement. It talks about a motion. How

61
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:30,729
我们从起源到点P？我们怎么去那里？好吧，我们遵循这条道路
do we get from the origin to the point P? How do we get there? Well, we follow the path

62
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:35,080
这是这个向量，这个箭头。另一个重要的考虑因素是这个向量
which is this vector, this arrow. Another important consideration is that this vector

63
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:40,339
有一个特定的起点。因此，我们将其称为绑定向量。所以这
has a particular starting point. And so, we refer to this as a bound vector. So, this

64
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:45,370
这里用红色显示的向量与此向量不同。虽然他们也一样
vector here shown in red is different to this vector here. Although they’ve got the same

65
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:49,849
长度和它们有相同的角度，它们是不同的向量。重要的是留在
length and they’ve got the same angle, they are different vectors. Important to keep in

66
00:05:49,849 --> 00:05:54,710
请记住，在这个过程中，我们所有的载体都受到约束。他们有一个特别的开始
mind that in this course, all of our vectors are bound. They have a particular starting

67
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:59,659
点。它们是根据特定坐标系定义的。
point. They’re defined with respect to a particular coordinate frame.

68
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:04,819
我们可以表达该向量的另一种方式，即小写p，就单位向量而言。那么我们
Another way we can express this vector, lower case p, is in terms of unit vectors. So, let’s

69
00:06:04,819 --> 00:06:10,360
定义两个单位向量。这些是长度为1的向量，I表示具有长度的向量
define two unit vectors. These are vectors with a length of 1 and I denote those with

70
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,909
顶部的帽子符号。所以，我们有单位向量xhat和单位向量yhat。现在，
a hat symbol on top. So, we have the unit vector x hat and the unit vector y hat. Now,

71
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:24,210
我可以用两个组件来表达我的向量。一个分量是距离乘以
I can express my vector in terms of two components. One component is the distance a multiplied

72
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:30,830
通过单位向量xhat，再加上另一个向量，一个垂直向量，即距离b
by the unit vector x hat, plus another vector, a vertical vector, which is the distance b

73
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:38,400
乘以单位矢量yhat。所以，这是向量的组件表示
multiplied by the unit vector y hat. So, this is a component representation of a vector

74
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:42,270
我们将在本讲座中稍后使用这种表示法。
and we’ll be using this notation later on in this lecture.

75
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:48,129
重要的是，点和向量是不同的东西。点定义位置。我们做不到
Importantly, points and vectors are different things. A point defines a location. We can’t

76
00:06:48,129 --> 00:06:53,759
一起加两点。这没有道理。而且，我们也不能增加两点。它的
add two points together. It makes no sense. And, neither can we multiply two points. It’s

77
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:59,680
一个毫无意义的概念。矢量不定义位置。他们指定如何从一个
a meaningless concept. Vectors don’t define a location. They specify how to get from one

78
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:05,879
位置到另一个。向量是我们可以添加的东西，我们可以减去。而且，我们可以
location to another. Vectors are things that we can add and we can subtract. And, we can

79
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:11,259
将矢量乘以标量。我可以有一个矢量;我可以将它乘以2.现在，我
multiply a vector by a scalar. I can have a vector; I could multiply it by 2. Now, I

80
00:07:11,259 --> 00:07:15,789
有一个箭头，它的长度是两倍，但方向相同且开头相同
have an arrow that’s twice as long but in the same direction and with the same beginning

81
00:07:15,789 --> 00:07:21,319
作为我以前的载体。两点之间的差异是矢量。所以，我可以
as the vector that I had before. The difference between two points is a vector. So, I can

82
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:25,710
取两点之间的差异，结果不再是一个点，结果
take the difference between two points and the result is no longer a point, the result

83
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:32,339
现在是一个载体。而且，类似地，我可以根据矢量位移定义一个点
is now a vector. And, similarly, I can define a point in terms of a vector displacement

84
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:38,029
从最初的角度来看。因此对于二维情况，一个点由两个实数表示
from an initial point. So for the two-dimensional case, a point is represented by two real numbers

85
00:07:38,029 --> 00:07:43,339
并且矢量也由两个实数表示。但是，点和向量是不同的
and a vector is also represented by two real numbers. But, points and vectors are different

86
00:07:43,339 --> 00:07:47,539
的东西。我们在创建坐标时需要小心
things. We need to be careful when we create a coordinate

87
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:52,300
帧。这是标准方式。它被称为右手坐标系。和，
frame. This is the standard way. It’s referred to as a right-handed coordinate frame. And,

88
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:58,449
我们从x轴摆动90度直到y轴。而且，这是另一个例子
we swing from the x-axis through 90 degrees up to the y-axis. And, here is another example

89
00:07:58,449 --> 00:08:03,960
右手坐标系。如果我们将框架倒置，我们现在
of a right-handed coordinate frame. If we were to flip the frame upside down, we now

90
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:09,249
x轴在此方向，y轴向下。所以，我们将在90年代
have the x-axis in this direction and the y-axis down. So, we would swing this in 90

91
00:08:09,249 --> 00:08:16,169
向下倾斜以定义y轴。现在，我们需要非常一致
degrees downwards in order to define the y-axis. Now, we need to be very consistent in the

92
00:08:16,169 --> 00:08:20,830
我们定义坐标框架的方式，我们总是会使用右手坐标
way we define the coordinate frames and we’re always going to use a right-handed coordinate

93
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:25,599
帧。我们永远不会使用这样的坐标框架，只有这样的框架。
frame. We will never use a coordinate frame like this, only frames that look like this.

94
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,639
当我们从两个轴构造二维坐标系时，实际上有两个
When we construct a two-dimensional coordinate frame from two axes, there are in fact two

95
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,979
我们可以用不同的方式构建坐标系。一个所谓的左撇子
different ways that we can construct that coordinate frame. A so called left-handed

96
00:08:34,979 --> 00:08:40,050
坐标框架和右手坐标框架。现在，在这个过程中，我们只会去
coordinate frame and a right-handed coordinate frame. Now, in this course, we’re only going

97
00:08:40,050 --> 00:08:45,240
处理右手坐标系。那么，我们如何构建一个右手坐标
to deal with right-handed coordinate frames. So, how do we construct a right-handed coordinate

98
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:51,529
帧？好吧，我们首先绘制x轴，然后通过摆动创建y轴
frame? Well, we start by drawing the x-axis first and the y-axis is created by swinging

99
00:08:51,529 --> 00:08:58,339
x轴逆时针方向90度。这给了我们一个右手坐标
the x-axis 90 degrees in the counterclockwise direction. That gives us a right-handed coordinate

100
00:08:58,339 --> 00:09:02,949
帧。所以，无论坐标框架的方向是什么，相对方向
frame. So, no matter what the orientation of the coordinate frame, the relative orientation

101
00:09:02,949 --> 00:09:08,829
x和y轴非常关键，它必须遵循这个惯例。另一个重要
of the x and y axes is really critical and it must follow this convention. Another important

102
00:09:08,829 --> 00:09:15,040
要记住的是欧几里德几何只适用于飞机。而且，欧几里得之一
thing to keep in mind is that Euclidean Geometry only applies to planes. And, one of Euclid’s

103
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,949
假设或公理对此非常非常清楚，那就是平行线永远不会
postulates or axioms is very, very clear about this, and that is that parallel lines never

104
00:09:19,949 --> 00:09:23,180
相交，当然，就是在飞机上的情况。
intersect and that is, of course, the case on a plane.

105
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:28,910
然而，在诸如球体之类的东西上，例如，我们星球的表面，这不再是
However, on something like sphere, for instance, the surface of our planet, this no longer

106
00:09:28,910 --> 00:09:34,440
是的。赤道上的平行线将在两极交叉。的规则
holds true. Parallel lines at the equator will intersect at the poles. The rules of

107
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,959
欧几里德几何不适用于这样的表面，但我们会说表面
Euclidean Geometry do not apply on such a surface, but we would say that the surface

108
00:09:39,959 --> 00:09:46,959
地球导致非欧几里德几何。然而，在一个小区域，欧几里德
of the Earth leads to a non-Euclidean Geometry. However, over a small area, the Euclidean

109
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,959
几何是一个非常好的近似。所以，在一个房间的规模，甚至可能甚至结束
Geometry is a very good approximation. So, over the scale of a room, maybe even over

110
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:56,689
城市规模，欧几里德几何-平行线不相交的事实
