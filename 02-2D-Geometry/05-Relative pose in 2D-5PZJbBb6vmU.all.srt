1
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:07,790
我们已经谈过如何描述位置和方向，一个人的姿势
We’ve talked about how we can describe the position and orientation, the pose of one

2
00:00:07,790 --> 00:00:12,499
相对于另一个坐标框架。在这里，我们有两个标记的坐标框架
coordinate frame with respect to another. Here, we have two coordinate frames labeled

3
00:00:12,499 --> 00:00:19,590
A和B，我们在这里使用这个符号来表示B相对于A的姿势。我已经介绍过了
A and B, and we use this symbol here to denote the pose of B with respect to A. I've introduced

4
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,859
点P和我可以用两个向量来描述它。我可以用协调来描述它
a point P and I can describe it by two vectors. I can describe it with respect to coordinate

5
00:00:24,859 --> 00:00:30,640
框架A;那是蓝色箭头，或者是坐标框架B;那个红色的箭头。
frame A; that's the blue arrow, or with respect to coordinate frame B; that the red arrow.

6
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:37,660
我可以使用相对于帧B将关于帧A的矢量与矢量相关联
I can relate the vector with respect to frame A to the vector with respect to frame B using

7
00:00:37,660 --> 00:00:40,620
姿势和这个操作符，点。
the pose and this operator, the dot.

8
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:45,809
现在，让我们考虑引入另一个坐标系，坐标系C和I.
Now, let's consider that I introduce another coordinate frame, coordinate frame C and I

9
00:00:45,809 --> 00:00:51,829
有一个相对于B描述C的姿势。我可以描述这一点
have a relative pose that describes C with respect to B. And I can describe the point

10
00:00:51,829 --> 00:00:59,449
P相对于坐标系C的矢量。因此，这些相对姿势可以复合
P in terms of a vector with respect to coordinate frame C. So, these relative poses can be compounded

11
00:00:59,449 --> 00:01:07,290
或者组成，所以我可以首先到达姿势B，然后到达姿势C.
or composed, so I can get to the pose C by first of all getting to the pose B and then

12
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:12,890
走向姿势C.所以，有一些方法可以将这两个姿势加在一起，但是
getting to the pose C. So, there's some way that I can add these two poses together, but

13
00:01:12,890 --> 00:01:17,710
我们还没有准确描述一个姿势是什么。我将介绍另一个摘要
we haven't described yet exactly what a pose is. I'm going to introduce another abstract

14
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:24,890
运营商。这是一个圆圈内的加号，我打算称之为O+。所以，O+运算符
operator. It is a plus sign inside a circle, I'm going to call that O+. So, the O+ operator

15
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:31,310
允许我们加入或添加这两个姿势。所以，从帧A到帧的相对姿势
allows us to join or add these two poses. So, the relative pose from frame A to frame

16
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:40,170
B，O+从帧B到帧C的相对姿势给出了C相对的相对姿态
B, O+ the relative pose from frame B to frame C gives us the relative pose of C with respect

17
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:47,990
到A.这个O+运算符执行所谓的组合。它允许我们组成，复合，
to A. This O+ operator performs what is called composition. It allows us to compose, to compound,

18
00:01:47,990 --> 00:01:55,570
用引号添加两个姿势。然后，我可以使用我的点运算符进行转换
to add, in inverted commas, two poses together. Then, I can use my dot operator to transform

19
00:01:55,570 --> 00:02:02,979
从帧C到帧A的向量，我们可以无限延长这种方法。我可以
the vector from frame C to frame A, and we can extend this approach indefinitely. I can

20
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:07,100
复合尽可能多的相对姿势。
compound as many relative poses as I wish.

21
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:11,470
当我们谈论相对运动之类的事情时，记住这一点非常重要
When we talk about things like relative motions, it's really important to keep in mind that

22
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:16,720
你应用它们的顺序至关重要。现在，考虑一下这里的例子
the order in which you apply them is critically important. Now, consider the example where

23
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:23,140
我从参考框架移动，并在x中移动一个30厘米的坐标框架
I move from the reference frame and I move a coordinate frame 30 centimetres in the x

24
00:02:23,140 --> 00:02:28,800
方向，然后我旋转45度，我们定义旋转的约定;
direction and then I rotate it by 45 degrees, and we defined the convention for rotation;

25
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:35,090
这是45度的正旋转。现在，想象一下我在做这些操作
this is a positive rotation of 45 degrees. Now, imagine that I do these operations in

26
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:41,440
相反的顺序。所以，我采用我的参考坐标框架，并将其旋转45度
the reverse order. So, I take my reference coordinate frame and I rotate it by 45 degrees

27
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:47,020
然后我在x方向上翻译30厘米。所以，现在我最终得到了
and then I translate it by 30 centimetres in the x direction. So, now I end up with

28
00:02:47,020 --> 00:02:52,730
这里有一个坐标框架。所以，你看到通过改变我申请的顺序
a coordinate frame over here. So, you see that by changing the order in which I apply

29
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:58,050
这些基本动作，翻译和旋转，我最终都有很大不同
these elementary motions, the translation and the rotation, I end up with very different

30
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:01,670
坐标框架。订购非常重要。
coordinate frames. Ordering is really important.

31
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:06,460
让我们看一个更复杂的例子，我在这里介绍了一个世界坐标框架。
Let's look at a more complex example, and I've introduced here a world coordinate frame.

32
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:11,780
现在，我介绍一个坐标框架，它表示我的机器人在桌子上的姿势。
Now, I introduce a coordinate frame which represents the pose of my robot on the table.

33
00:03:11,780 --> 00:03:16,670
这是一个坐标框架，代表小机器人的姿势。这是
And here's a coordinate frame which represents the pose of the little robot. And here is

34
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:21,010
另一个坐标框架，代表大机器人的手。我可以形容
another coordinate frame which represents the hand of the big robot. And I can describe

35
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:26,430
机器人手的姿势与机器人本身的关系。我可以介绍另一个
the pose of the hand of the robot with respect to the robot itself. I can introduce another

36
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:32,230
坐标框，描述正在查看这两者的相机的姿势
coordinate frame which describes the pose of a camera which is looking at both of these

37
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:37,910
机器人。而且，我也许可以根据我的世界坐标来描述相机的姿势
robots. And, I can perhaps describe the pose of the camera with respect to my world coordinate

38
00:03:37,910 --> 00:03:42,930
帧。也许相机能够分辨机器人的位置，相对于相机而言
frame. And perhaps the camera is able to tell where the robot is, with respect to the camera's

39
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:48,310
坐标框架。而且，也许相机也可以告诉我小机器人的姿势
coordinate frame. And, perhaps the camera can also tell me the pose of the little robot

40
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,970
相对于相机的坐标系。现在，我可能有兴趣知道，
with respect to the camera's coordinate frame. And now, I might be interested in knowing,

41
00:03:52,970 --> 00:03:57,790
这个小机器人相对于大机器人的姿势是什么？或者我可能想知道
what's the pose of the little robot with respect to the big robot? Or I might want to know

42
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,870
是的，从大机器人的手到小机器人的相对姿势是什么，万一
is, what's the relative pose from the hand of the big robot to the little robot, in case

43
00:04:02,870 --> 00:04:07,340
这个大机器人想触摸这个小机器人？或者，也许我可能想知道，是什么
the big robot wanted to touch the little robot? Or, perhaps I might want to know, what's the

44
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:12,660
关于世界坐标框架的大机器人手的姿势？我已经介绍过了
pose of the hand of the big robot with respect to the world coordinate frame? I've introduced

45
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:19,410
而是很多坐标框架和相对姿势。我们可以通过介绍来简化这个
rather a lot of coordinate frames and relative poses. We can simplify this by introducing

46
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,980
我称之为姿势图。所以，我保持相同的颜色编码，我保持不变
what I call a pose graph. So, I’ve kept the same colour coding and I kept the same

47
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,590
标签。
labeling.

48
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:30,540
现在，我不是通过二维坐标系表示姿势，而是简单地用它表示
Now, instead of representing a pose by a two-dimensional coordinate frame, I represent it simply by

49
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:37,620
一张光盘。连接光盘的线代表相对姿势并注意到它们
a disc. The lines that join the discs represent the relative poses and notice that they are

50
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:45,160
带箭头的线条，所以这个东西是有向图。实线代表相对
lines with an arrow so this thing is a directed graph. The solid lines represent relative

51
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:51,440
我们知道的姿势和虚线代表我们不知道的姿势，但也许我们可以
poses that we know and the dashed lines represent poses that we don't know, but perhaps we can

52
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:52,320
计算它们。
compute them.

53
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,530
所以，让我们在这里强调这个特殊的相对姿势，并说我想确定
So, let's highlight this particular relative pose here and say I want to determine the

54
00:04:57,530 --> 00:05:02,290
这个特定相对姿势的价值。我怎么做？好吧，我们要做什么
value of this particular relative pose. How do I do that? Well, what we’re going to

55
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:07,970
要做的是遵循一条路径，该路径具有相同的起点和相同的结尾
do is to follow a path through the graph that's got the same starting point and the same ending

56
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:14,510
点。旅程的第一站是这里的箭头，然后我从姿势C走向姿势
point. The first leg of the journey is this arrow here, and then I go from pose C to pose

57
00:05:14,510 --> 00:05:22,660
R然后去摆姿势H.我们可以说这个相对姿势等于构图
R and then go to pose H. We can say then that this relative pose is equal to the composition

58
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:29,420
这些其他3个相对姿势。如果我加入这个，这个，这一起让我得到了
of these other 3 relative poses. If I join this, this, and this together it gets me to

59
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:34,850
姿势图中的相同位置。所以，这是一种我可以计算未知的方法
the same place in the pose graph as this. So, this is a way I can compute an unknown

60
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:38,500
我所知道的相对姿势的相对姿势。
relative pose in terms of relative poses that I know.

61
00:05:38,500 --> 00:05:43,940
我们来看一个更复杂的例子。现在，我想知道这个相对的姿势：在哪里
Let's have a look at a more complex example. Now, I want to know this relative pose: where

62
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:49,990
是关于大机器人之手的小机器人。同样的规则。我想要
is the little robot with respect to the hand of the big robot. Same rule again. I want

63
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:55,570
找到通过这个图表的另一条路径，从H到L。我的第一站
to find another path through this graph that takes me from H to L. The first leg of the

64
00:05:55,570 --> 00:06:00,720
旅程将成为这一次。但在这种情况下，我们需要沿着这个箭头倒退，
journey is going to be this one. But in this case we need to go backwards along this arrow,

65
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,430
所以我把它涂成了红色，表明我正沿着这个特殊的方向前进
so I've coloured it in red to indicate that I'm going backwards along this particular

66
00:06:05,430 --> 00:06:09,930
图的一部分。然后我将沿着图的这一部分向后走，然后我就是
part of the graph. Then I'm going to go backwards along this part of the graph and then I'm

67
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:14,860
沿着图的这一部分前进。而现在，当我写作
going to go in the forward direction along this part of the graph. And now, when I write

68
00:06:14,860 --> 00:06:22,090
姿势表达式，我引入了两个新符号。这是圆圈内的减号
the pose expression, I've introduced two new symbols. It's a minus sign inside a circle

69
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:27,800
我将把这个运算符称为O-。所以，对于相对姿势的情况
and I'm going to refer to this operator as O-. So, for the case of the relative poses

70
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,550
用红色编码，我们沿着箭头向后移动，我已经为这个姿势加了前缀
that are coded in red, where we went backwards along the arrow, I've prefixed that pose by

71
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:38,960
一个减号，因为我走向了相反的方向。虽然这个在这里，但我已经习惯了
a minus sign because I've gone in the reverse direction. Whereas this one here, I've used

72
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:44,560
O+操作符，因为我沿着箭头向前移动。所以，这是一种方式
the O+ operator because I'm going in the forward direction along the arrow. So, here is a way

73
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:49,810
我可以根据以前已知的姿势定义一个未知的姿势。
that I can define an unknown pose in terms of previously known poses.

74
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:55,680
我们现在得到的是某种姿势代数，只有一些简单的规则
What we’ve got now is some kind of pose algebra and there are just a few simple rules

75
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:03,460
用姿势代数。第一条规则涉及O+运算符。我可以结合两个亲戚
with a pose algebra. The first rule is concerned with the O+ operator. I can combine two relative

76
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:08,630
提出另一个相对姿势，但有一些非常重要的规则相关联
poses to get another relative pose but there are some really important rules associated

77
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:13,340
这里有所有下标。第一个规则是这两个下标，一个在上面
with all the subscripts here. The first rule is that these two subscripts, the one on the

78
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:18,110
O+运算符的任一侧必须相同。你可以把它们想象为取消
either side of the O+ operator, must be the same. And you can think of them as cancelling

79
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:25,150
出。然后，这个前导下标在表达式和下标的两边是相同的
out. Then, this leading subscript is the same on both sides of the expression and this subscript

80
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:31,650
在表达的两边是相同的。O+运算符不是可交换的
is the same on both sides of the expression. The O+ operator is not commutative and that

81
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:39,070
意味着，如果我有一个相对姿势1和一个具有相对姿势2的O+，那么，一般来说，
means that if I have a relative pose 1, and an O+ with relative pose 2, that is, in general,

82
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:45,490
不同于相对姿势2O+相对姿势1.你必须非常小心
different to relative pose 2 O+ relative pose 1. You have to be really careful about the

83
00:07:45,490 --> 00:07:52,889
订单，你不能随意切换它们。另一个规则是应用O-运算符
order and you can’t arbitrarily switch them around. Another rule is that O- operator applied

84
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:58,510
相对姿势与交换前导和尾随标签相同。另一个规则
to the relative pose is the same as swapping the leading and trailing labels. Another rule

85
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:05,780
是我姿势O-相同的姿势，结果为零。它对应于没有动作，
is that I have pose O- the same pose, the result is zero. It corresponds to no motion,

86
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:12,660
没有姿势变化，我们使用符号零来表示。而且，我可以表达的另一种方式
no pose change and we use symbol zero to represent that. And, another way I can express that

87
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:18,960
是否定姿势然后将其添加到姿势，结果为零。这两个表达方式
is to negate the pose and then add it to the pose, the result is zero. These two expressions

88
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:25,169
是等价的。最后，如果我将零相对姿势添加到姿势，则不会发生任何变化。
are equivalent. Finally, if I add the zero relative pose to a pose, it makes no change.

89
00:08:25,169 --> 00:08:31,169
而且，如果我从姿势中减去零相对姿势，它就不会改变。
And, if I subtract the zero relative pose from a pose, it makes no change.

90
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:36,539
这些只是我们可以应用于这些复杂姿势表达式的一些简单代数规则
These are just a few simple algebraic rules that we can apply to these complex pose expressions

91
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:41,839
这允许我们重新排列它们以确定我们想要的东西
which allows us to rearrange them to determine the things that we want in terms of the things

92
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:48,140
我们知道。有一些规则也适用于我们合并的这个点运算符
that we know. There are a few rules also that apply to this dot operator where we combine

93
00:08:48,140 --> 00:08:54,839
一个带有向量的姿势。而且，我们在这里有一些适用于标签的规则。一次
a pose with a vector. And again, we have some rules that apply to the labels here. And once

94
00:08:54,839 --> 00:09:00,760
再次，最里面的标签必须是相同的。然后，我们可以将它们视为取消
again, the innermost labels must be the same. And then, we can think of them as cancelling

95
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,520
out和领先的标签是一样的。
out and the leading labels are the same.
