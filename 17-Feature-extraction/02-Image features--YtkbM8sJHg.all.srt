1
00:00:03,159 --> 00:00:06,990
我想区分称为图像处理的技术，和
I’d like to make a distinction between the techniques known as image processing, and

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:12,500
被称为计算机视觉的技术。图像处理是一种需要的技术
the techniques known as computer vision. Image processing is a technique that takes

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:17,480
一个图像，并产生另一个图像。它通常用于图像增强。在这
an image and produces another image. It’s often used for image enhancement. In this

4
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:23,570
例如，我们看到一个医学图像，其中身体内的特征相当模糊，并且
example we see a medical image where features within the body are rather indistinct, and

5
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:27,380
通过对其应用图像处理技术，它们得到了增强。他们有
by applying an image processing technique to it, they have been enhanced. They have

6
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:33,440
更高的对比度，更容易看到身体内的电线和其他结构。
higher contrast and it is easier to see the wires and other structures inside the body.

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:37,309
另一方面，计算机视觉，或者有时被称为机器视觉，需要一个
Computer vision, on the other hand, or machine vision as it’s sometimes called, takes an

8
00:00:37,309 --> 00:00:43,789
图像和生成功能。我们在这里看到的是具有大量彩色的输入图像
image and produces features. What we see here is an input image with a large number of coloured

9
00:00:43,789 --> 00:00:47,280
像素。有些是黄色的，有些是灰色的，有些是蓝色的。它正在生产什么
pixels. Some are yellow, some are grey, some are blue. And what it’s producing on the

10
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,920
右侧是仅描述黄色物体的特征。我们可以在这里看到
right-hand side are features which describe just the yellow objects. And we can see here

11
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:57,690
我们已经突出了这些物体的中心，我们也放了红框
that we’ve highlighted the centres of those objects, and we’ve also put red boxes around

12
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,129
它们显示了它们的空间范围。所以我们减少了整体信息量
them that show their spatial extent. So we’ve reduced the amount of information from a whole

13
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:10,660
很多颜色像素到一堆非常简洁的中心和坐标坐标信息
lot of colour pixels to a bunch of quite succinct information for coordinates of centres and

14
00:01:10,660 --> 00:01:14,670
四个边界框角落的坐标。
the coordinates of the corners of four bounding boxes.

15
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:18,860
我们称之为图像特征的相关信息实际上有三个
That pertinent information we refer to as image features and there are really three

16
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:24,050
常用的不同类型的图像功能。第一个是地区;该
different kinds of image features that are in common use. The first one is regions; the

17
00:01:24,050 --> 00:01:28,670
我刚刚给出的例子。对于这些黄色物体中的每一个，我可能都有兴趣知道
example that I just gave. For each of these yellow objects, I might be interested in knowing

18
00:01:28,670 --> 00:01:32,810
他们的中心在哪里，他们有多大，他们的形状是什么，方向是什么。
where’s their centre, how big are they, what shape are they, what’s the orientation.

19
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:38,220
它们是否指向侧面，是否垂直指向。还有其他功能
Are they pointing sideways, are they pointing vertically. And there are other features that

20
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,209
我们可以用它来描述这些黄色物体的形状。
we could use to describe the shape of these yellow objects.

21
00:01:43,209 --> 00:01:48,310
另一种非常常见的特征是线条。线条无处不在。肯定在
Another kind of very common feature are lines. And lines are everywhere. certainly in the

22
00:01:48,310 --> 00:01:53,030
建设环境。所以我们可能会对这些主导的方程式感兴趣
built environment. So we might be interested in what are the equations of these dominant

23
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:58,440
图像中的线条。我们可能对这些线的起点和终点感兴趣，
lines in the image. We might be interested in the start and end points of these lines,

24
00:01:58,440 --> 00:02:04,860
可能划定屋顶区域或建筑物边缘的线段。
the line segments that perhaps might delineate an area of a roof or the edge of a building.

25
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:10,810
我们在计算机视觉中使用的最后一种功能是点。我在这里做的是
The last kind of feature that we use in computer vision are points. Here what I’ve done is

26
00:02:10,810 --> 00:02:15,910
覆盖在建筑物的图片上，称为兴趣点。这些是要点
overlaid onto a picture of a building what are called interest points. These are points

27
00:02:15,910 --> 00:02:23,050
它包含大量信息，并且很容易在另一个视图中找到
that contain a lot of information and would be easy to find in another view of that same

28
00:02:23,050 --> 00:02:28,500
建造。所以圆圈表示这些兴趣点的中心和大小
building. So the circles indicate the centre of these interest points and the size of the

29
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:34,550
圈子说明了这些兴趣点的规模。现在，兴趣点和
circle says something about the scale of those interest points. Now, interest points and

30
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:38,570
我们将在本系列讲座中介绍积分的规模，但是
the scale of points is not something we’re going to cover in this lecture series, but

31
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:42,750
当然这是一个关于哪些文献很多的话题，而且它们是非常的
certainly it’s a topic about which there is a lot of literature, and they are a very

32
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,730
现代计算机视觉中的重要概念。让我们再回过头来考虑一下地区
important concept in modern computer vision. Let’s go back again and consider region

33
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:52,400
功能，这是我们将在本讲座中讨论的内容。你可能会有一个问题
features, which is what we are going to talk about in this lecture. A question you might

34
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,080
想问一下这个标志上的符号在哪里;字母和其他字母在哪里
like to ask is where are the symbols on this sign; where are the letters and the other

35
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,290
图形元素。好吧，如果我们找到区域功能，我们就能解决这个问题。
graphical elements. Well if we find region features we are able to solve this problem.

36
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:08,010
而我在这里用一些非常简单的代码完成的工作就是放置一个边界框
And what I’ve done here with a bit of quite simple code, is to put a bounding box around

37
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:13,610
这个黑色标志上的每个不同的白色符号。
each of the distinct white symbols on this otherwise black sign.
