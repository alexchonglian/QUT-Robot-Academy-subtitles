00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:08,119
今天我们要讨论一个问题，这实际上是机器人视觉的核心。
Today we're going to talk about a problem, which is really at the heart of robotic vision.

2
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:13,560
机器人是相对简单的机器。如果我们考虑工业机器人的情况，
Robots are relatively simple machines. If we consider the case of an industrial robot,

3
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:18,929
一个有六个关节，我们可以通过简单地指定六个速度来控制它
one that's got six joints, we can control that by simply specifying six velocities or

4
00:00:18,929 --> 00:00:25,260
速度。我们指定每个电机的速度，机器人可以做任何动作。
speeds. We specify the speed of each of its motors and the robot can do any kind of action.

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:30,460
轮式移动机器人，我们通过简单地指定两个速度来控制;这就是速度
A wheeled mobile robot, we control by specifying simply two velocities; that's the velocity

6
00:00:30,460 --> 00:00:35,920
它向前行驶的速度和转弯的速度。所以我们遇到了问题
at which it drives forward and the velocity at which is turns. So we've got a problem

7
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,890
因为从相机发出的数据量大约是数百万的数量级
because the amount of data that comes out of a camera is of the order of 10's of millions

8
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,320
每秒像素数;每秒数百万的数字。但我们只需要两个或者
of pixels per second; 10's of millions of numbers per second. But we need only two or

9
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,850
六，极少数，以实际控制机器人。这就像试着喝酒
six, a very small number, in order to actually control the robot. It's like trying to drink

10
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:54,850
从消防水带出来;来自相机的大量数据，少量的
out of a fire hose; massive amount of data coming out of the camera, small amount of

11
00:00:54,850 --> 00:01:00,150
控制机器人所需的数据。因此，为了解决这个问题，我们执行了一项技术
data needed to control the robot. So to get around this problem we perform a technique

12
00:01:00,150 --> 00:01:05,670
被称为“特征提取”，我们要做的就是找到图像的本质;
called "Feature Extraction" and what we're trying to do is find the essence of the image;

13
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:09,960
图像中最重要的信息，我们可以直接喂我们的机器人。
the most important information in the image, we can feed directly to our robot.
