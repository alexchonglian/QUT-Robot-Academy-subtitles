1
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:09,630
这是关节角速度和末端执行器速度之间的线性关系
This is the linear relationship between joint angle velocity and end effector velocity that

2
00:00:09,630 --> 00:00:16,500
我们刚刚解决了。这里的雅可比矩阵J是一个二乘二矩阵，意思是
we worked out a moment ago. The Jacobian matrix here J is a two by two matrix and that means

3
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:21,610
反转非常容易，所以我们可以像这样编写表达式。这是什么
that it's very easy to invert, so we can write the expression like this. And what this is

4
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:27,370
说如果我知道我想要的末端效应器速度，以及我是否可以计算雅可比行列式
saying is if I know the end effector velocity that I want, and if I can compute the Jacobian

5
00:00:27,370 --> 00:00:33,300
矩阵，然后反转它，我可以计算出我需要的关节角度速度
matrix and then invert it, I can work out what joint angle velocities I need in order

6
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:40,000
实现这种特殊的末端效应器速度，这是一个非常强大的东西。不管
to achieve this particular end effector velocity and this is a very powerful thing. No matter

7
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,690
最终效应器速度是什么，我总能计算出一组关节角速度
what the end effector velocity is, I can always work out a set of joint angle velocities that

8
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:49,120
会给我那个末端效应器的速度。
will give me that end effector velocity.

9
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,999
我们之前已经研究过Jacobian矩阵对于这个简单的两个连接平面
We've previously worked out what the Jacobian matrix is for this simple, two link, planar

10
00:00:53,999 --> 00:00:59,469
操纵器，因为它只是一个二乘二矩阵，它很容易反转和
manipulator and because it's only a two by two matrix, it's very easy to invert and the

11
00:00:59,469 --> 00:01:05,799
逆看起来像这样。这种逆雅可比行列有一个稍微有问题的方面
inverse looks like this. There's one slightly problematic aspect of this inverse Jacobian

12
00:01:05,799 --> 00:01:11,680
这就是这个术语，当第二个关节角度Q2等于零时，这个是逆的
and that is this term here, when the second joint angle, Q2 is equal to zero, this inverse

13
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,119
雅可比人变得无限。这可能看起来有点不寻常，但有一个漂亮的
Jacobian becomes infinite. That might seem a little bit unusual but there's a pretty

14
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:18,649
这背后的简单直觉。
simple intuition behind this.

15
00:01:18,649 --> 00:01:22,540
让我们来看看发生这种情况的机器人配置。所以这就是机器人
Let's have a look at the robot configuration where this occurs. So this is what the robot

16
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:27,869
当Q2等于零时看起来像。而且这种机器人的特殊配置经常是
looks like when Q2 is equal to zero. And this particular configuration of the robot is often

17
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:33,859
被称为奇异姿态，因为它在雅可比行列中引入了一个奇点
referred to as a singular pose because it introduces a singularity into the Jacobian

18
00:01:33,859 --> 00:01:39,950
机器人矩阵。像这样的机器人配置与a完全相同
matrix of the robot. A robot configuration like this is really exactly the same as a

19
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:44,149
单链接机器人看起来像这样，所以这是一个只有一个关节的机器人
single link robot that looks like this, so this is a robot which only a single joint

20
00:01:44,149 --> 00:01:49,869
角度。显然，像这样的机器人运动非常非常有限。末端效应器
angle. And clearly a robot like this has got very, very limited motion. The end effector

21
00:01:49,869 --> 00:01:56,409
这里的速度只能与这个蓝色矢量平行。这与之相关
velocity can only ever be parallel to this blue vector here. That is tangential to the

22
00:01:56,409 --> 00:02:01,600
机器人链接的轴。机器人末端执行器不可能在此移动
axis of the robot's link. It's not possible for the robot end effector to move in this

23
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,759
方向，这就是奇点来自的地方。在这个特别的
direction at all and this is where the term singularity comes from. In this particular

24
00:02:06,759 --> 00:02:12,270
机器人的配置，它失去了一定的自由度。机器人中有一个方向
configuration of the robot, it's lost a degree of freedom. There is a direction in the robot's

25
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:17,780
笛卡尔工作空间，其中末端执行器不可能移动。
Cartesian workspace, in which it is impossible for the end effector to move.

26
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:22,930
即使关节角度不完全等于零;也许它几乎为零，然后我们
Even if a joint angle in not exactly equal to zero; perhaps it's nearly zero, then we

27
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:28,310
在机器人能够移动的方向上仍然会有问题。所以一个机器人
will still have problems in the directions that the robot is able to move. So a robot

28
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:34,310
在这种配置中，将难以在这个特定方向上移动。
in this sort of configuration will find it difficult to move in this particular direction.

29
00:02:34,310 --> 00:02:38,510
我们可以计算雅可比矩阵的行列式，如果它等于零或是否等于零
We can compute the determinant of the Jacobian matrix and if it's equal to zero or if it's

30
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:43,080
等于小，告诉你机器人有一些运动方向
equal to small, that tells you that there is some motion direction for the robot that

31
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:48,051
将是困难或尴尬。你可以根据自己的手臂来考虑这一点;那里
will be difficult or awkward. You can think about this in terms of your own arm; there

32
00:02:48,051 --> 00:02:53,370
是一些手臂的配置，你有能力移动几乎相同
are some configurations of the arm where you have the ability to move with almost equal

33
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:56,902
在许多不同的方向上的速度和你的一些其他配置
velocity in many different directions and there are some other configurations of your

34
00:02:56,902 --> 00:03:01,560
手臂，它真的只能在一个方向上有速度;比如什么时候
arm, where it's really only possible to have velocity in one direction; for instance when

35
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:05,140
你试图扔球，你把手臂放在你可以拥有的配置中
you're trying to throw a ball, you put your arm into a configuration where you can have

36
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:10,180
你希望球走的方向的最大速度，但几乎没有速度分量
maximum velocity in the direction you want the ball to go, but almost no velocity component

37
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:13,780
在与此正交的方向上。
in direction orthogonal to that.

38
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:19,010
描述这种情况的另一种方式是雅可比的条件数。
Another way to describe this situation is in terms of the condition number of the Jacobian.

39
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:23,230
条件数是一个标量，我们可以从任何矩阵和条件计算
The condition number is a scalar that we can compute from any matrix and if the condition

40
00:03:23,230 --> 00:03:28,980
数字很​​大表明矩阵接近于单数，这就是它的确定
number is large it indicates that the matrix is close to being singular, that is it's determine

41
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:34,150
接近于零。您可以考虑雅各比矩阵的这种有问题的情况
is close to zero. You can consider this problematic situation of the Jacobian matrix in terms

42
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:39,570
它具有小的决定因素或大的条件数。条件号码
of it having either a small determinant or a large condition number. The condition number

43
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,819
可以使用内置函数“cond（）”在MATLAB中计算。
can be computed in MATLAB using the built in function "cond()".
