1
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:09,820
在本讲座中，我们将考虑单个机器人关节的速度如何影响
In this lecture we're going to consider how the velocity of a single robot joint affects

2
00:00:09,820 --> 00:00:15,799
末端执行器的速度。这里有几个动画显示简单的双链接
the velocity of the end effector. Here a couple of animations that show a simple two-linked

3
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:22,949
平面机器人。在左侧，我们看到一个示例，其中机器人的关节1正弦变化。
planar robot. On the left we see an example where joint 1 of the robot is varying sinusoidally.

4
00:00:22,949 --> 00:00:28,090
在右侧，我们看到一个示例，其中机器人的关节2正弦变化。但，
On the right we see an example where joint 2 of the robot is varying sinusoidally. But,

5
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:33,530
我们感兴趣的是各个关节的速度之间的关系
what we're interested in is the relationship between the velocities of the individual joints

6
00:00:33,530 --> 00:00:40,800
Q1或Q2和末端执行器的速度。我们将能够即时显示出来
Q1 or Q2 and the velocity of the end effector. In what we will be able to show is that instantaneously

7
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,500
末端执行器的速度是末端执行器速度分量的总和
the velocity of the end effector is the sum of the end effector velocity components due

8
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,370
关节1的运动和关节的运动2。
to motion of joint 1 and the motion due to joint 2.

9
00:00:51,370 --> 00:00:57,200
这是我们现在应该非常熟悉的双连杆机器人操纵器。我们展示了
Here's the two-linked robot manipulator which should be very familiar to us now. We showed

10
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:02,930
在之前关于正向运动学的讲座中，我们如何为x和x编写表达式
in the previous lecture about forward kinematics how we can write an expression for the x and

11
00:01:02,930 --> 00:01:09,910
机器人末端执行器的y坐标。这是机器人的二维效应器姿势。
y coordinate for the robot end effector. That is the robot’s end effector pose in two dimensions.

12
00:01:10,280 --> 00:01:15,500
现在，如果我们认为关节角度现在是时间的函数，那么我们就可以
Now if we consider that the joint angles are now are the function of time, then we can

13
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:22,170
计算x和y相对于时间的导数，这里的点符号表示
compute the derivative of x and y with respect to time and the dot notation here means the

14
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:27,659
关于时间的衍生物。所以xdot是x相对于时间的导数。
derivative with respect to time. So xdot is the derivative of x with respect to time.

15
00:01:27,659 --> 00:01:33,109
Q1点是关节角度Q1相对于时间的导数。
Q1 dot is the derivative of the joint angle Q1 with respect to time.

16
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:36,990
计算衍生工具是相当直接的。这几乎是介绍性差异
Computing the derivative is fairly straight forward. It's pretty much introductory differential

17
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,249
微积分，我们需要应用链规则。让我们把前面的方程式带到a
calculus and we need to apply the chain rule. Let's bring the previous equations on to a

18
00:01:42,249 --> 00:01:47,829
新页面。这里再次是xdot和ydot的表达式。
fresh page. And here again is the expressions for the xdot and ydot.

19
00:01:47,829 --> 00:01:54,119
现在在这个表达式中你注意到有许多Q1dot和Qdot术语。什么
Now in this expressions you notice that there are a number of Q1dot and Qdot terms. What

20
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,549
我们能做的就是我们能把它们分解出来。这使我们能够以非常好的方式编写表达式
we can do is we can factor them out. And that enables us to write the expression in a very

21
00:01:58,549 --> 00:02:03,579
紧凑的矩阵形式。如果您对此感到不舒服或者不理解我们是如何得到的
compact matrix form. If you uncomfortable with this or don't understand how we got from

22
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:09,450
矩阵形式的第一个表达式，乘以矩阵形式。乘以2x2矩阵
the first expression to the matrix form, multiply out the matrix form. Multiply the 2x2 matrix

23
00:02:09,450 --> 00:02:14,100
通过2x1向量并说服自己，它与我们开始时的表达方式相同。
by 2x1 vector and convince yourself that it's the same expression that we started with.

24
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:19,640
我们现在可以用非常简洁的形式写出来。向量xdot和ydot是速度
We can now write this in a very succinct form. The vector xdot and ydot is the velocity of

25
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:25,800
机器人末端执行器。通常用符号J表示的矩阵被引用
the robot end effector. The matrix which is typically denoted by the symbol J is referred

26
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:32,660
作为雅可比矩阵注意，该雅可比矩阵是关节角度Q1的函数
to as a Jacobian matrix. Note that this Jacobian matrix is a function of the joint angles Q1

27
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:39,290
和Q2。所以我们这里有一个关节角速度，矢量Qdot，
and Q2. So what we have here is a linear relationship between the joint angle velocity, vector Qdot,

28
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:47,750
其中包括Q1dot和Q2dot以及笛卡尔空间xdot和ydot中的尖端速度。
which comprises Q1dot and Q2dot and the tip velocity in Cartesian space xdot and ydot.

29
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:52,390
我们刚才介绍的雅可比矩阵是以这位先生的名字命名的。一个19世纪
The Jacobian matrix that we just introduced is named after this gentleman. A 19th century

30
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:57,860
数学家CarlGustavJacobJacoby。他对功能表达非常熟悉
mathematician Carl Gustav Jacob Jacoby. He's been very familiar with a functional expression

31
00:02:57,860 --> 00:03:04,370
像这样，y是x的函数，x是标量，y是标量。然后我们就可以写了
like this, y is a function of x, x is a scalar and y is a scalar. And then we could write

32
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:09,850
函数x相对于x的导数。它与y的导数相同
the derivative of the function x with respect to x. It's the same as the derivative of y

33
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:15,360
关于x。雅可比矩阵就是导数的矩阵等价物。它的
with respect to x. The Jacobian is simply the matrix equivalent of the derivative. It's

34
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:21,570
函数的导数，其参数是向量，其结果是向量。
the derivative of a function whose argument is a vector and whose result is a vector.

35
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:27,200
现在这些向量不必具有相同的长度。在这个例子中，x是一个向量
Now those vectors don't have to be the same length. In this example, x is a vector of

36
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,910
n维度和y是m维度的向量。
n dimensions and y is a vector of m dimensions.

37
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:36,860
所以我所说的雅可比矩阵是一个矩阵，在这种情况下它将是一个n乘m矩阵。
So the Jacobian as I said is a matrix and it will be in this case an n by m matrix.

38
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:41,830
矩阵的元素是每个输出的偏导数
The elements of the matrix are the partial derivatives of each of the outputs of the

39
00:03:41,830 --> 00:03:48,990
关于函数的每个输入的函数。简而言之，这就是雅可比风格。
function with respect to each of the inputs to the function. In a nutshell that's what a Jacobian is.

40
00:03:48,990 --> 00:03:52,360
当我们谈论运动学时，我们会介绍一种功能形式。
When we talked about kinematics, we introduce a functional form.

41
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:58,080
我们介绍了在机器人关节角度上运行的函数K并返回
We introduced the function K which operates on the robot joint angles and returns the

42
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,360
机器人姿势。现在我们正在考虑的双连杆机器人，关节角度属于
robot pose. Now for the two-link robot that we're considering now, the joint angles belong

43
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,450
到实数的二维空间和末端效应器的帖子也属于
to the two dimensional space of real numbers and the end effector post also belongs to

44
00:04:08,450 --> 00:04:11,060
二维空间或实数。
the two dimensional space or real numbers.

45
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:15,310
关节角度向量Q属于二维实数的空间，它是
The joint angle vector Q belongs to the space of two dimensional real numbers, it's the

46
00:04:15,310 --> 00:04:21,349
一组数字Q1和Q2。末端效应器的帖子属于二维空间
set of numbers Q1 and Q2. And the end effector post belongs to the two dimensional space

47
00:04:21,349 --> 00:04:25,710
实数。这就是说末端效应器的帖子由两个实数表示
of real numbers. That saying that the end effector post is represented by two real numbers

48
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:30,889
x和y。我们刚才介绍的另一个符号是空间速度。和
x and y. The other symbol that we introduced a moment ago is the spatial velocity. And

49
00:04:30,889 --> 00:04:35,740
我们使用希腊字母nu，它看起来像V和它的方便，因为它是一种类型
we used the Greek letter nu, it looks like a V and its handy because it is a type of

50
00:04:35,740 --> 00:04:41,360
速度，但它不仅仅是平原上的速度。它还包括旋转速度，
velocity but it's not just a velocity in the plain. It also includes rotational velocity,

51
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,660
当我们谈论在三维空间上运行的机器人时，这变得非常重要。
That becomes really important when we talk about robots that operates on three dimensional space.
