1
00:00:03,689 --> 00:00:08,809
这里再次是我们简单的双连杆平面机器人，我们现在要做的是
Here again is our simple two-link planar robot and what we're going to do now is to

2
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:16,630
将末端执行器速度视为一组非常特定的关节速度的函数。
consider the end effector velocity as a function of a very specific set of joint velocities.

3
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:21,950
这是一组幅度为1的联合速度。我们可以考虑这个问题
That's the set of joint velocities that have got a magnitude of 1. We can think about this

4
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:27,140
几何。我们感兴趣的是所有速度的集合
geometrically. What we're interested in is the set of all velocities that lie on this

5
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:33,930
红色圆圈。以下是该圈子的一般要点Q.指向这里和这里
red circle. Here is a general point Q that lies on that circle. Points here and here

6
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:39,760
仅对应于关节1的运动，这里的点对应于运动
corresponds to motion of joint 1 only and points here and here corresponds to motion

7
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,289
仅关节2。圆圈中的所有其他点对应于运动的混合
of joint 2 only. All the other points in the circle correspond to a mixture of motion of

8
00:00:45,289 --> 00:00:48,890
关节1和关节2。
joint 1 and of joint 2.

9
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,710
我们可以写出这个约束的另一种方法是速度位于红色圆圈上
Another way we could write this constraint that the velocity lies on the red circle is

10
00:00:53,710 --> 00:00:59,589
就该载体而言，载体产物。它与点积相同。相同的点积
in terms of this vector, vector product. It's the same as the dot product. Same dot product

11
00:00:59,589 --> 00:01:06,560
Qdot与其本身的等于1.我们有一个关于雅可比的Qdot的表达式
of Qdot with itself is equal to 1. We have an expression for Qdot in terms of the Jacobian

12
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:12,500
矩阵逆和机器人末端执行器的速度。所以我可以替换这个表达式
matrix inverse and the velocity of the robot end effector. So I can substitute this expression

13
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:18,010
对于上面的Qdot，我得到一个看起来像这样的复杂表达式。
for Qdot into the above and I get a complex expression that looks like this.

14
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:23,830
那是什么意思？那么这是椭圆的等式。它是速度的椭圆
What does that mean? Well this is the equation for an ellipse. It's an ellipse in the velocity

15
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:30,110
空间。所以在坐标系xdot和ydot中，我们这里有一个表达式
space. So in the coordinate system xdot and ydot, what we have here is an expression for

16
00:01:30,110 --> 00:01:36,650
椭圆。所以这是椭圆xdot和ydot上的特定速度。发生了什么
an ellipse. So this is a particular velocity on that ellipse xdot and ydot. What happened

17
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:42,260
我们是否在关节空间中绘制了一组速度，这是一个圆圈
is we've mapped a set of velocities in the joint space which was a circle into a set

18
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:48,790
最终效应器速度空间中的速度和椭圆。这说的是什么
of velocities in the end effector velocity space and that is an ellipse. What this says

19
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:54,040
是机器人能够在y方向上达到相当高的速度但相对而言
is that the robot was able to achieve quite a high speed in the y direction but a relatively

20
00:01:54,040 --> 00:02:01,400
x方向低速。因此它可以在y方向上快速前进，在x方向上更慢。
low speed in the x direction. So it can go fast in the y direction and more slowly in the x direction.

21
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:06,760
现在我绘制的这个椭圆是关节角度配置的函数。形状
Now this ellipse that I've drawn is a function of the joint angle configuration. The shape

22
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:11,540
椭圆的大小取决于机器人关节角度的配置方式。
of the ellipse depends on the way the robot joint angles are configured.

23
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:18,840
让我们来看看这个例子，以获得这背后的直觉。再次，这是我们的双链机器人。
Let's have a look at the example to get the intuition behind this. Once again, this is our two-linked robot.

24
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:24,720
如果我移动关节1，那么链接1的末端将以这样的速度移动。和
And if I moved joint 1 then the end of link 1 will move with the velocity like this. And

25
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:31,200
如果我移动关节2，那么链接2的末端将以这样的速度移动。结束
if I move joint 2 then the end of link 2 will move with the velocity like this. The end

26
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,910
效应器速度是这两个速度的矢量和。我们可以添加两个向量
effector velocity is the vector sum of these two velocities. We can add the two vectors

27
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,700
这是结果。
together and this is the resultant.

28
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,240
而我们在这种特殊配置中看到的机器人能够更快地移动
And what we see in this particular configuration, the robot was able to move more quickly in

29
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:51,370
垂直方向比水平方向。所以对于相等的关节速度，
the vertical direction than it can do in the horizontal direction. So for equal joint velocities,

30
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:57,170
我们通常会在不同的笛卡尔方向上获得均匀的速度。这取决于
we will in general get an even velocity in the different Cartesian directions. This depends

31
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:01,090
关于机器人的配置。
on the robot's configuration.

32
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:07,000
让我们看看机器人的速度椭圆如何随机器人的配置而变化
Let's have a look at how the robot's velocity ellipse changes shape as the robot's configuration

33
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,510
变化。我已经导入了双连杆平面机械手的模型。我策划并创作了
changes. I've imported a model of the two-linked planar manipulator. I plotted and I created

34
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:17,069
这里有一个教学窗口。所以我们可以看到侧面的蓝色面板有两个滑块
a teach window here. So we can see the blue panel on the side has got a couple of sliders

35
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:22,200
这让我可以改变机器人的关节角度。这是一个简单的看法。自上而下
that allow me to change the joint angles of the robot. This is a plain view. A top down

36
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,150
机器人机械手的视图。
view of the robot manipulator.

37
00:03:25,150 --> 00:03:30,930
我要做的第一件事就是稍微调整关节1滑块。在这里我们可以看到
First thing I'm going to do is to adjust the joint 1 slide a little bit. Here we can see

38
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:36,160
机器人的速度椭圆。它确实非常非常瘦。那是因为机器人是
the robot's velocity ellipse. It's very, very skinny indeed. That's because the robot is

39
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:41,450
在一个接近奇异的条件下。我们看到在这样的配置中，机器人能够
at a near singular condition. We see that in configuration like this, the robot is able

40
00:03:41,450 --> 00:03:46,010
向左和向右移动很快。但它几乎完全无法完成
to move quite quickly towards the left and the right. But it's almost completely unable

41
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:53,030
向上或向下移动。这里的配置接近于奇点和相似性
to move either upwards or downwards. The configuration here is close to singularity and similarity

42
00:03:53,030 --> 00:03:59,090
当第二个关节角度非常接近0时出现。让我增加第二个
came about when the second joint angle was very close to 0. Let me increase the second

43
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:04,030
关节角度。现在将要发生的是椭圆越来越宽。
joint angle. What's going to happen now is that the ellipse gets wider and wider.

44
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:11,160
机器人远离奇点，现在处于关节角度的配置
The robot is further away from singularity and is now in a configuration of joint angles

45
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:17,459
这使得它可以很容易地沿着链路2的方向移动或者与链路正交
that allows it to move quite readily along the direction of link 2 or orthogonal to link

46
00:04:17,459 --> 00:04:23,690
2.现在，如果我减小第二个关节角度Q2，使其接近0，我们看到椭圆
2. Now if I reduce the second joint angle, Q2, make it close to 0, we see that the ellipse

47
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:33,130
将变得更瘦，更瘦。最终它将成为一条直线为0的椭圆。
is going to get skinnier and skinnier. Ultimately it will become an ellipse of 0 with a straight line.
