1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:09,670
在这个讲座中，我想要做的是谈论机器人末端执行器的速度。
In this lecture, what I want to do is talk about the velocity of the robot's end-effector.

2
00:00:09,670 --> 00:00:13,930
所以在最后几个讲座中，我们研究了前向运动学和前进等概念
So the last couple of lectures, we have looked at concepts like forward kinematics and forward

3
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:18,590
运动学是关节角度与机器人末端执行器之间的关系
kinematics is the relationship between the joint angles and the robot's end-effector

4
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:23,330
姿势，所以我放入关节角度，然后我走出末端效应器的姿势。
pose, so I put in the joint angles and I get out the end-effector pose.

5
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:27,750
反向运动学恰恰相反。我说我希望末端效应器摆出姿势
The inverse kinematics is sort of the opposite. I say what I want the end-effector pose to

6
00:00:27,750 --> 00:00:33,440
是为了实现我需要的关节角度算法的结果
be and what comes out of the algorithm of the joint angles that I need in order to achieve

7
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:36,200
那个末端效应器的姿势。
that end-effector pose.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,390
问题是，我们将在这个特定的讲座中讨论的是速度变换。
The problem, what we are going to talk about in this particular lecture is velocity transform.

9
00:00:41,390 --> 00:00:47,920
如果关节以这个特定的速度移动，那么机器人的末端执行器的速度是多少
If the joints move at this particular velocity, what is the velocity of the robot's end-effector

10
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,950
并且你注意到我已经将关节的速度写成q点，所以点代表
and you note that I have written the velocity of the joints as q-dot, so dot represents

11
00:00:53,950 --> 00:01:00,559
时间变化率。它是微分学中常见的符号和姿势
the time rate of change. It is a common notation in differential calculus and the pose of the

12
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,750
机器人的末端执行器我一直用这个符号psiE来表示姿势
robot's end-effector I have been using this symbol, psi E, to represent the pose of the

13
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:11,189
终末效应者，我们已经谈到了这是如何组合位置和方向。
end-effector and we have talked about how that is combination of position and orientation.

14
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:16,590
因此，在这种特殊情况下，我们现在谈论的是余弦点。我们正在谈论
So, in this particular case, what we are talking about now is cosine dot. We are talking about

15
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:22,149
姿势的变化率，这是一个有趣的，不一定是直观的
the rate of change of a pose and that is an interesting and not necessarily intuitive

16
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:26,399
事情;所以首先我们要讨论姿势的变化率
thing; so first of all we are going to talk about what does the rate of change of a pose

17
00:01:26,399 --> 00:01:31,549
意思是，我们用什么样的数学对象来表示那个，然后是什么
mean, what kind of mathematical object do we use to represent that and then what is

18
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:38,240
那个东西，psi点和关节角度的变化率之间的关系
the relationship between that thing, the psi dot, and the rate of change of the joint angles

19
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:39,639
机器人本身。
of the robot itself.

20
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:43,950
所以，这就是本讲座的内容。它是关于理解之间的关系
So, that is what this lecture is about. It is about understanding relationship between

21
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:46,799
关节速度和姿势变化率。
velocity of the joints and the rate of change of pose.
