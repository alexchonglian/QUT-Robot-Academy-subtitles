1
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:08,930
我们将介绍一个称为分辨率运动控制的重要概念。听起来
We're going to introduce an important concept called resolved rate motion control. It sounds

2
00:00:08,930 --> 00:00:14,440
很复杂，但它真的很容易理解。对于很多现实世界的问题，我们可能会
complex but its really quite simple to understand. For a lot of real world problems, we might

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:20,270
感兴趣的是机器人末端执行器在笛卡尔空间中沿直线移动。
be interested in the robot end effector moving along a straight line in Cartesian space.

4
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,560
现在我们知道，如果我们移动，例如，关节角度1，我们移动关节角度2，然后
Now we know that if we move, for instance, joint angle 1, we move joint angle 2, then

5
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,590
机器人的末端往往在空间中以弧形移动。我们不希望它在弧形中移动。
the end of the robot tends to move in arcs in space. We don't want it to move in arcs.

6
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:34,090
我们希望它沿直线移动。所以我们开始指定笛卡尔速度
We want it to move along a straight a line. So we began to specify the Cartesian velocity

7
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:41,070
我们希望末端效应器跟随。我们想将其转换为所需的关节速度。
that we want the end effector to follow. We want to convert that then to the required joint velocity.

8
00:00:41,110 --> 00:00:46,110
我们已经触及过这一点。我们采用所需的速度nu，我们乘以逆
We already touched on this. We take the desired velocity nu, we multiply it by the inverse

9
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:52,089
雅可比人，我们得到了我们需要的联合速度。我们计算逆Jacobian，
Jacobian and we get the joint velocity that we need. We compute that inverse Jacobian,

10
00:00:52,089 --> 00:00:57,070
我们可以像在这里一样象征性地写出来。现在我需要做的就是拥有
we can write it out symbolically as I had done here. Now what I need to do is have the

11
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:02,790
机器人的硬件以所需的速度移动关节。但在机器人移动之后
robot's hardware move the joints at this desired velocity. But after the robot's been moving

12
00:01:02,790 --> 00:01:07,600
在短时间内，关节角度矢量Q将改变为雅可比
for a short period, the joint angle vector Q will have changed so that that Jacobian

13
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:13,140
我计算过的将不再合适。所以我需要做的是定期
that I've computed will no longer be appropriate. So what I need to do then is periodically

14
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:19,000
更新雅可比矩阵。当我计算所需的机器人速度矢量时使用它
update the Jacobian matrix. And use that when I'm computing the desired robot velocity vector

15
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:26,440
Q点。所以这是移动机器人关节，更新雅可比，计算机器人的问题
Qdot. So it's a matter of moving the robot joints, updating the Jacobian, computing the

16
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:33,880
机器人关节速度，移动关节，更新雅可比等。无限期地重复这个。
robot joint velocity, moving the joints, updating the Jacobian and so on. Repeat this indefinitely.

17
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:39,310
大多数在数​​字计算机上运行的控制算法通常是离散时间算法。
Most control algorithms that run on a digital computer a typically discrete time algorithms.

18
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:44,390
那就是他们以离散的时间间隔计算东西。所以我们有一个时间表和
That is they compute things at discrete time intervals. So here we have a time line and

19
00:01:44,390 --> 00:01:51,000
我们指出了一些时间步骤。时间1，时间2，时间3等。持续时间
we indicated a number of time steps. Time 1, time 2, time 3 and so on . The duration

20
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:56,159
在这些时间步骤中，我将用符号deltaT表示。它可能是1/10
of these time steps, I’m going to denote by the symbol delta T. It might be 1/10 of

21
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,450
一秒钟它可能是千分之一秒。这样的事情。每时每步都是什么
a second it might be a thousandth of a second. Something like that. At every time step what

22
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:07,180
我要做的是取出关节角度的当前值并称之为QK。那
I'm going to do is to take the current value of the joint angles and call that QK. That

23
00:02:07,180 --> 00:02:10,129
代表K时的关节角度。
stands for joint angles at the time K.

24
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:15,140
要计算雅可比行列式，请采用逆，乘以我想要的速度
To compute the Jacobian, take the inverse, multiply it by the velocity that I want to

25
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:21,610
实现并计算在这个特定时间步骤我需要实现的Qdot。什么
achieve and compute the Qdot that I need to achieve at this particular time step. What

26
00:02:21,610 --> 00:02:27,980
我要做的是采取联合速度Qdot我将它乘以deltaT所以
I'm going to do is take that joint velocity Qdot I'm going to multiply it by delta T so

27
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:33,160
这将给我一个关节角位移;这就是我想要关节多少
that will give me a joint angle displacement; that is how much I would want the joints to

28
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,180
移动到即将到来的时间间隔。
move over the coming time interval.

29
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:42,000
我将其添加到关节角度QK的当前值。这给了我机器人的机会
I add that to the current value of the joint angles QK. And that gives me the robot’s

30
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:47,740
目标。这就是我希望机器人关节角度在时间K+1的地方。然后我告诉了
target. That's where I want the robot joint angles to be at time K +1. Then I tell the

31
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:53,000
机器人硬件随着时间的推移将关节移动到这个新的关节角度配置
robot hardware to move the joints to this new joint angle configuration over the time

32
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:57,599
间隔deltaT.然后我会在必要时重复这些步骤。
interval delta T. And then I'll repeat this steps for as long as necessary.
