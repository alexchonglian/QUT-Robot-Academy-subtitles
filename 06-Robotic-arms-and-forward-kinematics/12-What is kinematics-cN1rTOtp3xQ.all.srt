1
00:00:03,669 --> 00:00:07,569
我在本次讲座中多次使用过运动学这个术语，但事实并非如此
I've used the term kinematics a number of times in this lecture and I haven't really

2
00:00:07,569 --> 00:00:13,950
非常明确这意味着什么。运动学是研究数学的数学分支
been very clear about what it means. Kinematics is a branch of mathematics that studies the

3
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:20,500
身体或身体系统的运动。运动学关注事物的位置
motion of a body or a system of bodies. Kinematics is concerned with the positions of things

4
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:25,789
或者事物之间的角度与速度有关。这些可以是转化的
or the angles between things and is concerned with velocities. These can be translational

5
00:00:25,789 --> 00:00:29,890
速度或它们可以是角速度。
velocities or they could be angular velocities.

6
00:00:29,890 --> 00:00:34,219
运动学不关心力和力矩。这是动态的业务。
Kinematics is not concerned with forces and moments. That's the business of dynamics.

7
00:00:34,219 --> 00:00:40,550
因此，在运动学中，人们研究机制，例如此处所示的机制并尝试理解
So in kinematics people study mechanisms such as the ones shown here and try to understand

8
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:45,280
一个身体的运动如何与另一个身体的运动相关。
how the motion of one body is related to the motion of another body.

9
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,219
我在这里展示了许多相当复杂的机制的例子。在运动学中，是
I have shown here examples of a number of quite complex mechanisms. In kinematics, is

10
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:57,499
研究这些机制的各个组成部分的运动。在机器人技术中，我们考虑
the study of the motion of the various components of these mechanisms. In robotics, we consider

11
00:00:57,499 --> 00:00:59,429
两个运动学问题。
two kinematic problems.

12
00:00:59,429 --> 00:01:04,190
首先，我们在这个特定的讲座中讨论的是所谓的前向运动学
First one, in what we discuss in this particular lecture is what's called the forward kinematic

13
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:10,690
问题。这是机器人关节角度，机器人工具尖端的姿势是什么？
problem. And that is given the robot joint angles, what's the pose of the robot's tool tip?

14
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:16,079
第二个问题称为反向运动学。我们将在下一个讨论这个问题
The second problem is called the inverse kinematics. And we're going to discuss that in the next

15
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:21,640
演讲。鉴于我知道我想要机器人在叛逃者身上的姿势，问题
lecture. Given that I know the pose that I want the robot in-defector to have, the problem

16
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:27,240
是为了确定实现这一目标所需的关节角度。让我来
is to determine what are the joint angles required in order to achieve that. Let me

17
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:30,210
留下你真正喜欢的这句话。这是关于运动学的。
leave you with this quote I really like. It's about kinematics.
