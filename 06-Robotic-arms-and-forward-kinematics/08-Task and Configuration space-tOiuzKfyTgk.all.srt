1
00:00:04,170 --> 00:00:09,090
我们现在要描述一些略微数学概念，但它们非常有用，
We’re now going to describe some slightly mathematical concepts but they’re very useful,

2
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,650
所以忍受我。
so bear with me.

3
00:00:11,650 --> 00:00:15,080
到目前为止，当我们谈论机器人时，我们一直在谈论关节
So far, when we’ve been talking about robots, we’ve been talking a lot about the joint

4
00:00:15,080 --> 00:00:16,080
角。
angles.

5
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,480
我们现在要做的是概括这个概念，我们将参考
What we’re going to do now is to generalize that concept and we’re going to refer to

6
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:23,869
概括联合坐标。
generalize joint coordinates.

7
00:00:23,869 --> 00:00:29,779
现在，对于关节旋转的大多数机器人来说，就是它们的旋转时间关节，
Now, for most robots where the joints are revolute, that is their rotating time joints,

8
00:00:29,779 --> 00:00:33,900
那么它们的广义联合坐标就是联合角度。
then their generalize joint coordinate is simply the joint angle.

9
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:40,030
但是，对于那些有滑动关节的少数机器人也被称为棱柱形
But, for those small number of robots that have got a sliding joint also known as a prismatic

10
00:00:40,030 --> 00:00:44,949
关节，则广义关节坐标则为长度，即长度
joint, then the generalize joint coordinate then would be a length, the length of that

11
00:00:44,949 --> 00:00:46,400
滑动关节。
sliding joint.

12
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:52,309
因此，概括联合坐标只是我们可以处理机器人关节的一种方式
So, generalize joint coordinate is simply a way that we can deal with robot joints that

13
00:00:52,309 --> 00:00:54,299
旋转或滑动。
either rotate or slide.

14
00:00:54,299 --> 00:01:00,670
因此，机器人的所有关节坐标的集合我们称为关节配置。
So, the set of all joint coordinates for the robot we referred to as the joint configuration.

15
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:06,590
它是一个向量，通常用符号Q表示。并且，向量的长度是
It’s a vector and typically denoted by the symbol Q. And, the length of the vector is

16
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:09,270
N和N是关节的数量。
N and N is the number of joints.

17
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:15,490
因此，关节配置Q是长度为N的向量，并且该向量的元素也是
So, joint configuration Q is a vector of length N and the elements of that vector are either

18
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:18,409
角度或长度。
an angle or a length.

19
00:01:18,409 --> 00:01:23,479
关节角度向量属于空间，空间C。
The joint angle vector belongs to a space, the space C.

20
00:01:23,479 --> 00:01:26,329
我们将此称为配置空间。
We refer to this as the configuration space.

21
00:01:26,329 --> 00:01:34,659
关节配置属于集合C，C是所有可能的关节配置的集合。
The joint configurations belong to the set C and C is the set of all possible joint configurations.

22
00:01:34,659 --> 00:01:40,420
现在，C是N维实数空间的子集。
Now, C is a subset of the N dimensional real number space.

23
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:44,950
当我们谈论机器人时，另一个非常重要的空间就是空间
The other space that’s really important when we’re talking about robots is the space

24
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:52,390
所有可能的末端效应器姿势，我们用符号T来指代。我们这样说
of all possible end effector poses and we refer to this by the symbol T. We say that

25
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:59,150
末端效应器姿势ksiE属于集合T，即所有可能的末端效应器的集合
the end effector pose ksi E belongs to the set T, the set of all possible end effector

26
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:00,150
构成。
poses.

27
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:06,350
在二维中，T是所有可能的平移和旋转的子集。
In two dimensions, T is a subset of all possible translations and rotations.

28
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:11,240
而且，它是一个子集的原因是机器人只有有限的范围。
And, the reason that it’s a subset is that the robot has only got finite reach.

29
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,879
它无法触及地平线。
It can’t reach out to the horizon.

30
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:21,220
例如，因此T是二维中所有可能位置和方向的子集。
For example, so T is a subset of all possible positions and orientations in two dimensions.

31
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:25,110
例如，我们已经看过简单描述末端执行器姿势的机器人
For example, we’ve looked at robots where the end effector pose is simply described

32
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:27,420
通过坐标X和Y.
by the coordinates X and Y.

33
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:32,530
我们还看了一些机器人，其中末端效应器的姿势由位置描述
We’ve also looked at some robots where the end effector pose is described by the position

34
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:36,170
X和Y以及方向Theta。
X and Y and by the orientation Theta.

35
00:02:36,170 --> 00:02:43,090
在三个维度中，我们会说T是SE3的子集，即所有可能位置的集合
In three dimensions, we would say that T is a subset of SE3, the set of all possible positions

36
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:46,030
和三维空间中的方向。
and orientations in three dimensional space.

37
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:52,299
并且，我们再次查看描述末端效应器姿势的一些具体示例
And, we’ve, again, look at some specific examples where the end effector pose is described

38
00:02:52,299 --> 00:02:57,239
就其位置X，Y和Z而言，一些机器人是末端执行器所构成的
just in terms of its position, X, Y and Z, some robots where the end effector pose is

39
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,650
由位置X，Y和Z以及单个俯仰角描述。
described by position X, Y and Z and a single pitch angle.

40
00:03:01,650 --> 00:03:05,760
我们还研究了一些机器人，它们的末端执行器可以用来描述
We’ve also looked at some robots whose end effector can be described in terms of the

41
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:13,120
例如，位置X，Y和Z以及定向滚动，俯仰和偏转角度。
position X, Y and Z and orientation roll, pitch and yaw angles for example.

42
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,239
这些都是SE3的子集。
These are all subsets of SE3.

43
00:03:15,239 --> 00:03:20,879
接下来重要的考虑因素是这些不同空间的尺寸
The next important consideration then is the dimensions of these different spaces, the

44
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,390
任务空间，我们描述末端执行器姿势的空间，以及配置
task space, the space in which we describe the pose of the end effector, and the configuration

45
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:30,950
我们描述机器人关节坐标的空间。
space in which we describe the joint coordinates of the robot.

46
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:35,410
我们说机器人有很多自由度，而且数量相等
We say that a robot has got so many degrees of freedom and that’s equal to the number

47
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:40,189
机器人具有的关节，这是其配置空间的尺寸。
of joints the robot has and that’s the dimension of its configuration space.

48
00:03:40,189 --> 00:03:46,230
所以，如果一个机器人有三个关节，那么我们就说它的配置空间已经到了
So, if a robot has got three joints, then we say that its configuration space has got

49
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:47,730
三个维度。
three dimensions.

50
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:52,440
同样，我们可以谈论任务空间中的自由度
Similarly, we could talk about the degrees of freedom in the task space and that’s

51
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:59,790
等于任务空间T的尺寸。考虑一个简单的平面机器人的姿势。
equal to the dimension of the task space T. Consider the pose of a simple planar robot.

52
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:05,120
它的末端执行器姿势简单地由两个坐标X和Y描述。
Its end effector pose is described simply by the two coordinates X and Y.

53
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,209
在这种情况下，任务空间的维度为2。
In this case, the dimension of a task space is 2.

54
00:04:08,209 --> 00:04:12,830
如果它是具有三个关节的平面机器人，则可以描述末端执行器姿势
If it’s a planar robot with three joints, then the end effector pose can be described

55
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:17,079
通过X和Y位置以及方向Theta。
by the X and Y position and the orientation Theta.

56
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:21,310
在这种情况下，我们会说任务空间的维度是3。
In this case, we would say that the dimension of a task space is 3.

57
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,450
它由三维矢量描述。
It’s described by a three-dimensional vector.

58
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:29,720
对于三维机器人，其末端执行器姿势由位置，坐标描述
For a three-dimensional robot whose end effector pose is described by the position, coordinates

59
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:35,160
X，Y和Z，其任务空间的维度也是3。
X, Y and Z, the dimension of its task space is also 3.

60
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:40,060
具有X，Y，Z位置以及俯仰角度，任务尺寸的机器人
The robot that has got X, Y, Z position and also a pitch angle, dimension of its task

61
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,360
空间是4。
space is 4.

62
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,650
并且，对于类似工业机器人的东西，其末端执行器姿势由位置描述
And, for something like an industrial robot whose end effector pose is described by position

63
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:52,110
X，Y，Z和方向可用三个角度描述，例如滚动，俯仰，
X, Y, Z and orientation which could be described by three angles, for instance, roll, pitch,

64
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:55,710
偏航角，其任务空间的维数为6。
yaw angles, the dimension of its task space is 6.

65
00:04:55,710 --> 00:04:59,320
在我们生活的三维世界和机器人居住的世界里，事实并非如此
In the three-dimensional world in which we live and which the robots live, it’s not

66
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,740
可以给出任务空间维度6。
possible to have a task space dimension be given 6.

67
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:09,880
现在，真正重要的约束是，为了达到所有的任务空间，
Now, the really important constraint is that in order to reach all of the task space, the

68
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,940
配置空间的尺寸应大于或等于尺寸
dimension of the configuration space should be greater than or equal to the dimension

69
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:17,050
任务空间。
of the task space.

70
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:20,550
为了使这个具体，让我们再看看我们应该的2自由度臂
To make this concrete, let’s look again at the 2-degree freedom arm which we should

71
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:22,390
现在非常熟悉。
be quite familiar with by now.

72
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:28,100
末端效应器姿势是任务空间的一个元素，任务空间是一个子集
The end effector pose is an element of the task space and the task space is a subset

73
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:31,380
实数的二维空间。
of the two-dimensional space of real numbers.

74
00:05:31,380 --> 00:05:35,680
末端效应器姿势可以用一对两个实数来描述。
End effector pose can be described by a pair of two real numbers.

75
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:41,580
该机器人的配置空间是包含Q1和Q2的矢量，两者
The configuration space for this robot is a vector that comprises Q1 and Q2, the two

76
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:43,030
关节角度。
joint angles.

77
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:48,470
配置空间也是实数二维空间的子集
The configuration space is also a subset of the two-dimensional space of real numbers

78
00:05:48,470 --> 00:05:54,030
因为关节配置可以用一对实数来描述，即Q1和
because the joint configuration can be described by a pair of real numbers, that is Q1 and

79
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:55,390
Q2。
Q2.

80
00:05:55,390 --> 00:06:01,590
对于3自由度臂，末端执行器姿势由三个数字X，Y和表示
For the 3-degree of freedom arm, the end effector pose is described by three numbers, X, Y and

81
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,590
西塔。
Theta.

82
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:07,970
所以，我们现在说任务空间是所有可能位置集合的子集
So, we say now that the task space is a subset of the set of all possible positions and the

83
00:06:07,970 --> 00:06:13,690
我们用S表示的所有可能方向的子集。配置空间是
subset of all possible orientations which we denote by S. The configuration space is

84
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:20,110
包含Q1，Q2和Q3的矢量，并且是三维空间的子集
a vector comprising Q1, Q2 and Q3 and that is a subset of the three dimensional space

85
00:06:20,110 --> 00:06:21,540
实数。
of real numbers.

86
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,530
到现在为止，我相信你已经掌握了这一点。
By now, I’m sure you’re getting the hang of this.

87
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:29,150
在这种情况下，任务空间是r立方体的一个子集，是三维真实的集合
In this case, the task space is a subset of r cubed, the set of three-dimensional real

88
00:06:29,150 --> 00:06:30,150
数字。
numbers.

89
00:06:30,150 --> 00:06:35,910
并且，配置空间也是实数的三维空间的子集。
And, the configuration space is also a subset of three-dimensional space of real numbers.

90
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:41,760
笛卡尔龙门机器人是一种特殊情况，因为关节坐标直接映射
A Cartesian Gantry robot is a special case because the joint coordinates directly map

91
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:44,680
到最后的效应器姿势。
on to the end effector pose.

92
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,890
关节坐标实际上是长度X，Y和Z.
The joint coordinates are in fact the lengths X, Y and Z.

93
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:55,630
4自由度SCARA机器人手臂具有由位置描述的末端执行器姿势
A 4-degree of freedom SCARA robot arm has an end effector pose described by a position

94
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:58,340
X，Y和Z以及偏航角。
X, Y and Z and a yaw angle.

95
00:06:58,340 --> 00:07:04,160
所以，我们会说它的任务空间是r立方体的一个子集，所有可能的集合
So, we would say that its task space is a subset of r cubed, the set of all possible

96
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:08,290
位置，以及所有可能方向的集合。
positions, and the set of all possible orientations.

97
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:15,130
它的配置空间是四维数量，它包括三个旋转
Its configuration space is a four-dimensional quantity and it comprises the three rotational

98
00:07:15,130 --> 00:07:19,060
关节角度和工具的垂直位移。
joint angles and a vertical displacement of the tool.

99
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:24,700
4自由度并联连杆机器人同样具有四维任务空间。
A 4-degree of freedom parallel link robot, again, has a four-dimensional task space.

100
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:31,110
它能够控制末端执行器的位置和方向，并且具有四维效果
It’s able to control the position and orientation of the end effector and it has a four-dimensional

101
00:07:31,110 --> 00:07:32,600
配置空间。
configuration space.

102
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:38,540
底座上有四个电机通过连接到末端执行器的连接。
There are four motors located at the base connected by links to the end effector.

103
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:44,620
我们之前看过的四个联合教育机器人有一个四维任务空间
The four joint educational robot that we looked at before has a four-dimensional task space

104
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:49,920
这可以通过位置X，Y，Z和俯仰角及其配置来描述
which can be described by a position X, Y, Z and a pitch angle, and its configuration

105
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:55,340
也是四维的，因为这个机器人有四个旋转关节。
is also four-dimensional because there are four rotational joints in this robot.

106
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:59,560
同样的事情适用于NAO机器人的手臂。
The same thing applies for an arm of the NAO robot.

107
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:06,260
对于如此处所示的6自由度臂，任务空间是SE3的子集，即
For a 6-degree of freedom arm such as shown here, the task space is a subset of SE3, the

108
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:12,190
三维空间中所有可能位置的集合以及所有可能方向的集合
set of all possible positions in three-dimensional space and the set of all possible orientations

109
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:14,170
在三维空间。
in three-dimensional space.

110
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:18,260
所有这些机器人的配置空间也是六维的。
The configuration space of all these robots is also six-dimensional.

111
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:21,470
它们都有六个关节或6个自由度。
They all have six joints or 6 degrees of freedom.

112
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:26,650
工业机器人和航天飞机臂有六个旋转关节。
The industrial robot and the space shuttle arm have got six rotational joints.

113
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:32,330
然而，斯坦福大学的手臂有五个旋转关节和一个滑动关节。
Whereas, the Stanford arm has got five rotational joints and one sliding joint.

114
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:33,390
这是一个非常特殊的情况。
This is a very special case.

115
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:37,830
这是一个具有大量旋转关节的机器人。
This is a robot with a very large number of rotational joints.

116
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:43,240
该机器人的任务空间与上一张幻灯片上的机器人完全相同。
The task space of this robot is exactly the same as the robots on the previous slide.

117
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:47,279
末端执行器姿势由其位置和方向描述。
The end effector pose is described by its position and by its orientation.

118
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:49,199
它有六个维度。
It’s got six dimensions.

119
00:08:49,199 --> 00:08:53,459
但是，像这样的机器人的配置空间可能非常庞大。
But, the configuration space for a robot like this could be quite massive.

120
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:57,700
我实际上并不知道这个机器人有多少关节，但我猜它是
I don’t actually know how many joints this robot’s got, but I’m guessing that it’s

121
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,769
有一百个关节。
got a hundred joints.

122
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:04,540
所以，我要说它的配置空间是100维空间的一个子集
So, I’m going to say that its configuration space is a subset of the 100-dimensional space

123
00:09:04,540 --> 00:09:05,839
实数。
of real numbers.

124
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:12,350
因此，在这种情况下，配置空间的维度大于该维度
So, in this case, the dimension of the configuration space is greater than the dimension of the

125
00:09:12,350 --> 00:09:13,920
任务空间。
task space.

126
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:16,330
我们称之为冗余机器人。
We call this a redundant robot.

127
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:21,370
冗余机器人的一个优点是刀尖可以实现任何位置和
An advantage of the redundant robot is that the tool-tip can achieve any position and

128
00:09:21,370 --> 00:09:26,580
方向就像一个6自由度的工业机器人，但它的附加
orientation just like a 6-degree of freedom industrial robot does, but with its additional

129
00:09:26,580 --> 00:09:30,800
自由度，它还可以控制手臂的形状。
degrees of freedom, it can also control the shape of the arm.

130
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,709
因此，它可以控制末端执行器的姿势和手臂的形状。
So, it can control the pose of the end effector and the shape of the arm.

131
00:09:35,709 --> 00:09:41,740
只有六个关节的工业机器人只能控制末端执行器的姿势。
An industrial robot with only six joints can only control the pose of the end effector.

132
00:09:41,740 --> 00:09:46,579
它不能选择其手臂的任意配置形状。
It can’t choose an arbitrary configurational shape of its arm.

133
00:09:46,579 --> 00:09:52,279
我们描述机器人手臂的另一种方式是配置字符串和这个
Another way that we describe robot arms is in terms of a configuration string and this

134
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:58,040
是一串字符，每个关节一个字符，字符是Rfor
is a string of characters, one character per joint and the character is either an R for

135
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:02,259
用于棱柱或滑动接头的旋转接头或P.
a rotational joint or P for a prismatic or sliding joint.

136
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:07,860
所以，在这里我们可以看到三种截然不同的机器人的配置字符串。
So, here we can see the configuration strings for three quite different sorts of robot.
