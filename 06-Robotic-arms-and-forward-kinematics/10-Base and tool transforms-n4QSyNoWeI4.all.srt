1
00:00:03,429 --> 00:00:08,900
考虑一个相当标准的工业机器人，有6个旋转接头试图添加一个
Consider a fairly standard industrial robot with 6 rotational joints. Trying to add a

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:15,609
在链接零上坐标框架并在链接6上添加一个坐标框架
coordinate frame on link zero and going to add a coordinate frame on link 6 which is

3
00:00:15,609 --> 00:00:20,570
末端执行器框架实际完成工作的机器人的位。我们谈了
the end-effector frame the bit of the robot that actually does the work. And we talked

4
00:00:20,570 --> 00:00:27,260
关于运动模型，其关于框架6的姿态与框架零和
about kinematic models which relate the pose of frame 6 with respect to frame zero and

5
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:32,940
它是机器人第6关节角度的函数。现在让我们说这个机器人存在
it's a function of the 6th joint angles of the robot. Let's say now that this robot exists

6
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,620
在工厂里，工厂有自己的世界坐标框架。
in a factory and the factory is got its own world coordinate frame indicated over here.

7
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:43,910
并且我们知道机器人的姿势相对于世界坐标系的零点。
And we know the pose of the robot link zero with respect to the world coordinate frame.

8
00:00:43,910 --> 00:00:50,329
我们称之为机器人的基本变换。机器人末端执行器的姿势
We called this the base transform of the robot. The pose of the robots end effector in the

9
00:00:50,329 --> 00:00:55,170
简单地通过复合基础变换就可以获得世界坐标系
world coordinate frame can be attained for it's simply by compounding the base transform

10
00:00:55,170 --> 00:01:01,930
通过机器人的正向运动变换，这是机器人关节角度的函数。
with the forward kinematic transform of the robot which is a function of the robot's joint angles.

11
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,420
想象一下，我现在介绍了另一个机器人，这个机器人从屋顶倒挂
Imagine now that I introduced another robot, this one's hanging upside down from the roof

12
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:11,770
并且我们知道它相对于世界坐标系的姿势然后我们可以写一个
and we know its pose with respect to the world coordinate frame then we can write an

13
00:01:11,770 --> 00:01:17,850
表达第二个机器人相对于世界的末端效应器姿势。
expression for the end-effector pose of the second robot with respect to the world.

14
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:24,260
现在，让我们看一下机器人的工具端。运动学为我们提供了机器人的姿势
Now, let's look at the tool end of the robot. The kinematics give us the pose of the robots

15
00:01:24,260 --> 00:01:29,060
末端执行器，但通常它确实给我们一些安装法兰的姿势
end effector but typically it actually does gives us the pose of some mounting flange

16
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:33,560
在机器人的末端，我们想为此加上某种工具。所以，我们
on the end of the robot and we would like to affix some sort of tool to that. So, we

17
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,420
这里要介绍工具，这是机器人的某种磨具
are going to introduce the tool here, this is some kind of grinding tool that the robot

18
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:43,470
正在携带。当然，我们对这个特定工具的业务端感兴趣。
is carrying. And of course, we're interested in the business end of this particular tool.

19
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:48,820
我们想知道这个坐标系的姿势。通过一些仔细的测量，
We want to know the pose of this coordinate frame here. In with some careful measurement,

20
00:01:48,820 --> 00:01:56,020
我们可以确定从第6帧到第E帧的相对姿势，这将是恒定的相对姿势。
we can determine the relative pose from the frame 6 to frame E and this would be constant relative pose.

21
00:01:56,020 --> 00:02:01,530
那么，现在关于世界坐标系的末端效应器的姿势可以
So, now the pose of the end-effector, with respect to the world coordinate frame, can

22
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:08,179
由这组复合姿势写成。它是基础变换的复合体
be written by this set of compounded poses. It's the base transform compounded with the

23
00:02:08,179 --> 00:02:14,879
臂的运动学模型与安装的恒定工具变换相结合
kinematic model of the arm compounded with the constant tool transform from the mounting

24
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,459
指向该工具的业务端。
point to the business end of the tool.

25
00:02:18,459 --> 00:02:21,529
这是我们以前的MATLAB会议之一，我们正在使用的模型
Here's one of our previous MATLAB sessions where we were working with a model of the

26
00:02:21,529 --> 00:02:28,349
Puma-560机器人。我们可以在Denavit-Hartenberg参数表下看到
Puma-560 robot. We can see here under the table of the Denavit-Hartenberg parameters

27
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:33,689
有一个基本变换矩阵和一个工具变换矩阵，它们各自对应
that there is a base transform matrix and a tool transform matrix and each of them corresponds

28
00:02:33,689 --> 00:02:40,659
零转和零转换。但我们可以轻松改变基础变换
to zero rotation and zero translation. But we can easily change the base transform of

29
00:02:40,659 --> 00:02:47,919
例如，通过调整串行链接机器人对象的基本属性来实现机器人。
the robot for instance by adjusting the base property of the serial link robot object.

30
00:02:47,919 --> 00:02:54,290
所以，我可能会改变基本变换的平移路径。也许，我会放置
So, I might change the translational path of the base transform. Perhaps, I will place

31
00:02:54,290 --> 00:03:00,900
机器人在X方向10米，Y方向15米，也许
the robot at 10 meters in the X direction and 15 meters in the Y direction and maybe

32
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:05,969
我会把它抬高一点，或者沿Z方向向上移动两米。所以，现在
I will put it up a little bit higher or move it up two meters in the Z direction. So, now

33
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:10,969
机器人对象有一个我们找到的不同的基础变换。
the robot object has got a different base transform that we find.

34
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:15,709
现在，计算机器人的正向运动学，这被考虑在内，我们可以
Now, compute the forward kinematics of the robot, this is taken into account and we can

35
00:03:15,709 --> 00:03:21,299
看到现在的末端效应器位置是完全不同的。基础变换非常好
see that the end-effector position now is quite different. The base transform is a very

36
00:03:21,299 --> 00:03:27,180
强大的功能，我可以设置一个更复杂的基础变换。例如，我实际上可以
powerful function and I could set a more complex base transform. For instance, I could actually

37
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,029
将机器人颠倒过来，我将围绕x轴旋转pi弧度
turn the robot upside down and I am going to rotate it around the x-axis by pi radians

38
00:03:32,029 --> 00:03:37,629
所以这就是机器人基础变换现在的样子，如果我再次计算前进
so this is what the robot base transform looks like now and if I again compute the forward

39
00:03:37,629 --> 00:03:43,180
对于同一组关节角度的运动学，我们将看到机器人末端执行器的位置
kinematics for that same set joint angles, we'll see that the position of the robot end-effector

40
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:48,019
是不同的，我们可以看到末端执行器的方向是非常不同的
is different and we can see that the orientation of the end-effector is very different the

41
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:51,949
旋转子矩阵中的正号和负号位于不同的位置。所以，
positive and minus signs in the rotations sub matrix are in different locations. So,

42
00:03:51,949 --> 00:03:57,569
我已经有效地移动了机器人并将其颠倒过来，这非常容易
I have effectively moved the robot and turn it upside down and that's very very easy to

43
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:01,719
做这个基础变换的概念。
do with this concept of a base transform.

44
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:05,499
我可能想对机器人做的另一件事是向它添加工具变换
The other thing that I might want to do to the robot is to add a tool transform to it

45
00:04:05,499 --> 00:04:11,680
并通过调整工具属性来做到这一点，我可能会声明该工具已经获得
and do that by adjusting the tool property and I might declare that the tool has got

46
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:17,739
x方向的偏移为零，Y方向的偏移为零，可能为0.2米
an offset of zero in the x direction, zero in the Y direction and perhaps it's 0.2 meters

47
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:23,169
在Z方向上指向机器人末端的安装板。
in the Z direction which is pointing out of the mounting plate on the end of the robot.

48
00:04:23,169 --> 00:04:28,590
现在，您可以看到工具变换代表有限位移。现在，
And now, you can see that the tool transform represents a finite displacement. And now,

49
00:04:28,590 --> 00:04:33,199
如果我要计算那组特定关节角度的正向运动学，我们会
if I'm going to compute the forward kinematics for that particular set of joint angles, we'll

50
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,800
看到末端效应器的位置略有不同，因为现在它正在使用这个工具
see that the end-effector position is slightly different because now it's taking this tool

51
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:41,559
转化为计数。
transform into a count.
