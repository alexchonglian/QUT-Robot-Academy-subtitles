00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:08,430
对任何机器人来说，一个非常重要的考虑因素是所有可能的点
A really important consideration with any robot is the set of all possible points that

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:09,510
它可以到达。
it can reach.

3
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:14,599
我们将此卷称为机器人的工作空间。
And we refer to this volume as the workspace of the robot.

4
00:00:14,599 --> 00:00:19,050
对于机器人随附的数据表中的大多数工业机器人手臂，您可以
For most industrial robot arms in the data sheet that comes with the robot, you could

5
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:21,380
找到看起来像这样的图表。
find the diagram that looks something like this.

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:25,920
它是机器人的平面图和侧视图。
It is a plain view and side elevation view of the robot.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,119
你在这里看到的标有蓝色的是机器人可达到的体积。
And what you can see here marked in blue is the reachable volume of the robot.

8
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:35,190
我们可以看到这个体积在机器人身体周围也无法到达。
We can see that this volume around the body of the robot where it cannot reach either.

9
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:40,300
这是由于特定关节或其运动范围的机械限制
And this is due to mechanical limits on the range of motion of particular joints or it’s

00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:45,170
机器人控制软件的神器，以防止手臂的部分相交或
an artifact of the robot control software to prevent parts of the arm intersecting or

00:00:45,170 --> 00:00:48,789
与机器人手臂或其基座的其他部分碰撞。
colliding with other parts of the robot's arm or its base.
