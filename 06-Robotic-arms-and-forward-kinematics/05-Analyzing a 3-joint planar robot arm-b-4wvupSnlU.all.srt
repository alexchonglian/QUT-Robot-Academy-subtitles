1
00:00:03,949 --> 00:00:06,649
现在我们要为我的机器人添加第三个链接。
Now we are going to add a third link to my robot.

2
00:00:06,649 --> 00:00:12,549
所以现在，我们有一个3自由度机器人，有3个旋转关节或3个旋转关节。
So now, we have a 3-degree of freedom robot with 3 revolute or 3 rotational joints.

3
00:00:12,549 --> 00:00:14,960
该机器人具有更大的工作体积。
This robot has a much larger working volume.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,590
它可以到达这个非常大的圆圈内的任何一点，但因为它有3度
It can reach any point within this very large circle here, but because it has got 3 degrees

5
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:25,070
自由意味着它不仅可以到达其工作空间内的任何特定位置。
of freedom it means it cannot only reach any particular position within its work space.

6
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:29,400
它还可以在该特定位置实现任何方向。
It can also achieve any orientation at that particular position.

7
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,090
例如，如果机器人的末端执行器位置在这里，则机器人具有3度
If for example the robot's end effector position is here, then the robot with 3 degrees of

8
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:39,340
自由能够实现机器人最后一个链接的任何仲裁方向。
freedom is able to achieve any arbitrate orientation of this last link of the robot.

9
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:44,440
我们可以看到我可以通过该链接和它的相当大范围的角度移动它
We could see I can move it through quite a large range of angles of that link and it

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:49,989
是可能的，因为它有1个额外的自由度。
is possible because it has 1 extra degree of freedom.

11
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:53,530
让我们确定我们的3连杆机器人的末端执行器的姿势。
Let us determine the pose of the end effector of our 3-link robot.

12
00:00:53,530 --> 00:00:58,680
我们要做的第一件事是注释机器人并引入机器人的长度
The first thing we are going to do is to annotate the robot and introduce the lengths of the

13
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,970
各种链接然后我们将介绍各种关节角度。
various links and then we are going to introduce the various joint angles.

14
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:08,500
该图中的Q1和Q2均为正，而Q3为负值。
Q1 and Q2 in this diagram are both positive and Q3 here is a negative value.

15
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:13,659
您注意到旋转方向与Q1和Q2的旋转方向相反。
You note that the direction of rotation is the opposite of that for Q1 and Q2.

16
00:01:13,659 --> 00:01:18,780
当我们为1和2联合机器人做这个时，我展示了坐标系的动画
When we did this for the 1 and 2 joint robots, I showed an animation of the coordinate frame

17
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,920
沿着链接从参考坐标系移动并最终到达末端效应器。
moving from the reference coordinate frame along the links and ending up at the end effector.

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,189
这次我不打算做那个动画。
I am not going to do that animation this time.

19
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:30,630
我认为你有了一般的想法，我们要做的就是写下来
I think you got the general idea and what we are going to do is just write down the

20
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,340
通过检查转换表达。
transform expression by inspection.

21
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:37,950
我们要做的第一件事是在Q1处旋转它，在X方向上平移
The 1st thing we are going to do is to rotate it at Q1, translate in the X-direction by

22
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:45,170
A1，以角度Q2旋转，沿X方向沿第二连杆平移量
A1, rotate by the angle Q2, translate along the 2nd link in its X-direction by the amount

23
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:52,130
然后旋转角度Q3，然后沿X方向平移一个量
of A2 and then rotate by the angle Q3 and then translate in the X-direction by an amount

24
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:53,130
A3。
A3.

25
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,709
再一次，我可以扩展这些矩阵并将它们相乘以得出它们
Once again, I can expand out what these matrices and multiply them together to come up with

26
00:01:58,709 --> 00:02:04,530
一个均匀的变换，代表这个3关节的末端执行器的姿势
a homogenous transformation which represents the pose of the end effector of this 3-joint

27
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:05,530
机器人。
robot.

28
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,670
为3连杆机器人手动完成这一点有点单调乏味。
To do this by hand for the 3-link robot is a little bit tedious.

29
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:09,670
我可能会犯一个错误。
I might make an error.

30
00:02:09,670 --> 00:02:12,340
所以我们将直接进入MATLAB并在那里完成。
So we are going to go straight to MATLAB and do it there.

31
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:18,049
现在，我们将使用MATLAB来计算这个3链路末端效应器的姿态
Now, we are going to use the MATLAB to compute the pose of the end effector of this 3-link

32
00:02:18,049 --> 00:02:19,049
平面机器人。
planar robot.

33
00:02:19,049 --> 00:02:21,599
这次我们将以符号形式进行。
We are going to do it just in symbolic form this time.

34
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:28,230
我创建了一些符号来表示3个链接长度：A1，A2和A3，它们代表
I create some symbols to represent the 3 links lengths: A1, A2 and A3 and they represent

35
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:33,110
3个关节角度：Q1，Q2和Q3。
the 3 joint angles: Q1, Q2 and Q3.

36
00:02:33,110 --> 00:02:38,519
再次，我们使用trchain2来运行，现在我传入的字符串描述了
Once again, we used the trchain2 to function and the string now I pass in describes the

37
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:42,209
坐标框架从机器人底部移动到尖端的方式。
way the coordinate frame moves from the base of the robot to the tip.

38
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:50,030
所以我要按角度Q1进行旋转，平移距离A1，旋转
So I am going to do a rotation by the angle Q1, translation by the distance A1, a rotation

39
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:56,560
通过角度Q2，在X方向上平移距离A2，另一次旋转
by angle Q2, translation in the X-direction by the distance A2, another rotation this

40
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,909
一个是角度Q3，另一个是沿着距离A3移动的距离
one by the angle Q3 and another translation by the distance A3 that is moving along the

41
00:03:02,909 --> 00:03:04,370
机器人的第3个环节。
3rd link of the robot.

42
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:11,121
现在，我将通过关节角度Q1，Q2和Q3的末端效应器，在这里，我们
Now, I am going to pass the end effector of the joint angles Q1, Q2 and Q3 and here, we

43
00:03:11,121 --> 00:03:16,930
有一个符号表达式，代表这个3连接的末端效应器的姿势
have a symbolic expression which represents the pose of the end effector of this 3-link

44
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:17,930
机器人。
robot.

45
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:22,880
你看，这是一个非常复杂的表达，因为我们需要侧向滚动才能看到结束
You see this is now quite a complex expression as we need to scroll sideways to see the end

46
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,329
它的。
of it.

47
00:03:25,329 --> 00:03:32,209
例如，x分量由结果的第1行和第3列给出
The x component for example is given by the 1st row and the 3rd column of the result that

48
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:37,239
我刚刚计算出来，这是最终效应器的X坐标的表达式
I just computed and that is the expression for the X-coordinate of the end effector of

49
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:40,110
3连杆机器人。
the 3-link robot.

50
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:46,650
我还可以导入平面三连杆机器人的模型，这是工具箱功能和
I can also import a model of a planar 3-link robot and that is the tool box function and

51
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:51,739
平面树在我们的工作区中创建一个串行链接对象。
the planar tree creates a serial link object in our workspace.

52
00:03:51,739 --> 00:03:57,519
该变量称为P3，并且我可以将一些方法应用于此对象
The variable is called P3 and there is some methods that I can apply to this object and

53
00:03:57,519 --> 00:03:59,239
我们之前看过的教学方法。
the teach method that we have looked at previously.

54
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,040
我可以在这个3连杆机器人上做到这一点。
I can do it on this 3-link robot and here it is.

55
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,360
我可以增加1号关节角度。
I can increase joint angle number 1.

56
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:07,879
我可以减少关节角度2。
I can decrease joint angle number 2.

57
00:04:07,879 --> 00:04:13,590
我可以增加3号关节角度，我们可以看到它移动，我们可以看到位置
I can increase joint angle number 3 and we can see it moving and we can see the position

58
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:18,050
当我调整这些滑块时，末端执行器的变化。
of the end effector changing as I adjust these sliders.
