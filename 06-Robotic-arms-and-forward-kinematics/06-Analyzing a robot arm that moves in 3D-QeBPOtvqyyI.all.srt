1
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:09,240
到目前为止我们看过的机器人在2D平面上移动但是大多数有用的机器人都移动了
The robots that we looked at so far move in the 2D plane but most useful robots move in

2
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,540
三个维度。我们现在要做的是确定末端执行器的姿势
three dimensions. What we want to do now is to determine the pose of the end effector

3
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:21,359
这个机器人在三维空间中移动。我们遵循的过程非常非常
of this robot which moves in three dimensional space. The process we follow is very, very

4
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:26,609
类似于我们为二维机器人所做的过程。首先我们介绍一下
similar to the process we did for the two dimensional robots. First of all we introduced

5
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:33,100
参考坐标系然后我们指示机器人的姿势对象的部分
a reference coordinate frame and then we indicate the part of the robot the object whose pose

6
00:00:33,100 --> 00:00:38,540
我们感兴趣的是，这是机器人的末端执行器，用符号ksiE表示。
we’re interested in, that’s the end effector of the robot indicated here by the symbol ksi E.

7
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:46,520
然后，第一步是围绕z轴旋转坐标系一个量Q1。然后
The first step then is a rotation of the coordinate frame about the z axis by an amount Q1. Then

8
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,510
我们在x方向上将该坐标系转换为A1的长度
we translate that coordinate frame in the x direction by an amount A1 the length of

9
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:58,380
第一个链接。然后我们再次围绕z轴旋转坐标系Q2。
the first link. Then we rotate the coordinate frame about the z axis again by an amount Q2.

10
00:00:58,380 --> 00:01:04,199
接下来，我们在X方向上转换A2，即第二个的长度
Next we translate in the X direction by an amount A2 that’s the length of the second

11
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:12,250
链接。然后我们再次围绕Z轴旋转角度Q3，最后我们翻译
link. Then we rotate around the Z axis again by the angle Q3 and finally we translate in

12
00:01:12,250 --> 00:01:14,950
Z方向的量为Q4。
the Z direction by the amount Q4.

13
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:22,909
我们现在已经将机器人末端执行器的姿势描述为链，一系列基本的
We now have described the pose of the robot’s end effector as a chain, a sequence of elementary

14
00:01:22,909 --> 00:01:29,030
齐次变换矩阵。所有矩阵都属于集合SE3
homogeneous transformation matrices. All of the matrices belong to the set SE3 that’s

15
00:01:29,030 --> 00:01:34,729
三维空间中所有旋转和平移的集合。我们可以扩大
the set of all rotations and translations in three dimensional space. We could expand

16
00:01:34,729 --> 00:01:39,310
将每个基本矩阵中的每个矩阵相乘并将它们相乘以得出
out each of these elementary matrices and multiply them all together to come up with

17
00:01:39,310 --> 00:01:44,829
一个单一的同质转换度量表示姿势的最终效应器
a single homogeneous transformation metric representation the pose the end effector of

18
00:01:44,829 --> 00:01:51,610
这个Scara机器人。这个小机器人已经四个自由度，四个旋转关节。
this Scara robot. This small robot has gone four degrees of freedom, four rotational joints.

19
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:57,790
所以第一次旋转是围绕这样的轴。你看到整个手臂都在转动
So the first rotation is around an axis like this. You see that the whole arm rotates around

20
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:02,130
基地。第二个旋转关节有一个像这样的轴，我们可以说是
the base. The second rotating joint has got an axis like this and we can say that the

21
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:08,399
整个臂可以绕这个轴旋转。第三个关节绕该轴旋转，
whole arm can rotate around this axis here. The third joint is rotation around this axis,

22
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:14,560
你看到长臂绕着它旋转而第四个关节是一个旋转
you see that longer arm rotates around that and the fourth joint is a rotation around

23
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:20,100
这里有一个轴。您可以看到整组机构相对于下臂旋转。
an axis here. You can see that the whole group of mechanism rotates with respect to the lower arm.

24
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:25,240
让我们看看这四个联合教育机器人吧。我们有一个相当的
Let’s finish off by looking at this four joint educational robot. We've had quite a

25
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:30,379
现在我们应该能够写下机器人的表达式
bit of practice by now that we should be able to write down the expression for the robot

26
00:02:30,379 --> 00:02:33,190
末端效应器几乎通过检查。
end effector pose almost by inspection.

27
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:37,440
所以这就是我思考这个问题的方式。我想机器人已经拉长了
So this is the way I think about the problem. I imagine that the robot is stretched down

28
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,879
垂直，两根手指指向天空，然后我写下序列
vertically with its two fingers pointing to the sky and then I just write down the sequence

29
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:47,950
变形首先，机器人绕参考Z轴旋转
of transformations. First of all the robots rotates around the reference Z axis by the

30
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:53,459
量Q1然后我们向上移动一点，这是在Z方向，然后我们旋转
amount Q1 and then we move up a little bit which is in the Z direction and then we rotate

31
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,120
围绕Y轴的量为Q2。
around the Y axis by the amount Q2.

32
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,409
然后我们向上移动一点，然后遇到下一个关节，我们绕着旋转的关节3
Then we move up a little bit and encounter the next joint, joint 3 we rotate around the

33
00:03:01,409 --> 00:03:07,430
Y轴的量Q3然后我们在Z方向上向上移动了一点点
Y axis by the amount Q3 then we move up a bit more in the Z direction encounter the

34
00:03:07,430 --> 00:03:13,739
最后一个关节，关节4我们围绕Y轴旋转关节角度Q4。然后我们搬家
last joint, joint 4 we rotate around the Y axis by the joint angle Q4. And then we move

35
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:17,890
在Z方向上向上一点，直到我们到达手指的尖端。
up a bit more in the Z direction until we reach the tip of the fingers.

36
00:03:17,890 --> 00:03:25,489
因此，只需通过联合，精神上通过机器人机制联合，我们链接
So just by mentally walking through the robot mechanism joint by joint, link by link we

37
00:03:25,489 --> 00:03:29,810
可以写下末端效应器姿势的表达式。然后这很简单
can write down an expression for the pose of the end effector. Then it’s a simple

38
00:03:29,810 --> 00:03:34,560
扩展矩阵然后将它们相乘的问题。和我们
a matter of expanding out the matrices and then multiplying them all together. And we

39
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,769
可以使用像MATLAB这样的工具让我们很容易。
can use a tool like MATLAB to make that very easy for us.

40
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:43,110
现在我们将使用MATLAB来确定该机器人的末端执行器的姿势
Now we’re going to use MATLAB to determine the pose of the end effector of this robot

41
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:47,790
它以三维方式移动，我们将以象征性的方式进行，但首先是
which moves in three dimensions and we’re going to do this symbolically but first of

42
00:03:47,790 --> 00:03:54,049
我将为各种链接长度A1，A2，A3和定义一些符号变量
all I’m going to define some symbolic variables for the various link lengths A1, A2, A3, and

43
00:03:54,049 --> 00:04:04,189
A4以及四个关节角度Q1，Q2，Q3和Q4。我们将使用trchain
A4 and also for the four joint angles Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4. We’re going to use the trchain

44
00:04:04,189 --> 00:04:08,700
功能再次。这次我们将使用名为trchain的函数进行操作
function again. This time we’re going to use the function called trchain which operates

45
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,689
在三个维度而不是在二维操作的函数trchain2
in three dimensions rather than the function trchain2 which operates in two dimensions

46
00:04:13,689 --> 00:04:15,620
我们在前面的例子中使用过的。
that we used in the previous examples.

47
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:20,239
现在我开始编写这个变换字符串，这样我们就可以围绕它进行旋转了
And now I start to write this transform string so we’re going to do a rotation around the

48
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:27,630
Z轴由Q1然后我们将在A1方向进行Z方向的平移
Z axis by Q1 and then we’re going to do a translation in the Z direction by A1 then

49
00:04:27,630 --> 00:04:32,580
我们将在第二季度围绕Y轴进行旋转，然后我们将会这样做
we’re going to do a rotation around the Y axis by Q2 and then we’re going to do

50
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:40,470
A2的另一个Z方向平移，然后我们将轮换
another translation in the Z direction by A2 and then we’re going to do a rotation

51
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:46,210
在Q3附近围绕Y轴然后我们将在Z方向上进行另一次平移
around the Y axis by Q3 and then we’re going to do another translation in the Z direction

52
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:54,340
通过A3然后我们将在Q4绕Y轴旋转，最后进行平移
by A3 and then we’re going to do a rotation around the Y axis by Q4 and finally a translation

53
00:04:54,340 --> 00:04:56,160
在A4方向的Z方向。
in the Z direction by A4.

54
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:07,800
我关闭了那根弦，现在我传递了关节角度Q1，Q2，Q3和Q4，在这里我们
I close that string and now I pass in the joint angles Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4 and here we

55
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:14,320
具有表示该机器人姿态的均匀变换的表达式
have the expression for the homogeneous transformation which represents the pose of this robot which

56
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:19,720
三维移动。因为机器人的三维操作是均匀的
moves in three dimensions. Because the robot’s operating in three dimensions this homogeneous

57
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:25,000
变换是一个四乘四的矩阵。我们可以看到它非常庞大而复杂
transformation is a four-by-four matrix. And we can see that it’s quite a large and complex

58
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,729
表达式，我需要横向滚动很多才能结束它。
expression and I need to scroll sideways quite a lot to get to end of it.

59
00:05:30,729 --> 00:05:35,210
如果我想确定这个机器人的末端执行器的X坐标，我会的
If I wanted to determine the X coordinate of the end effector of this robot I would

60
00:05:35,210 --> 00:05:40,780
通过获取此同类的第一行和第四列中的元素来做到这一点
do that by taking the element in the first row and the forth column of this homogeneous

61
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:45,500
转换矩阵，这将是该机器人的X坐标的表达式
transformation matrix and that would be the expression for the X coordinate of this robot

62
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,750
而且这本身就是一个非常复杂的表达。
and again that itself is quite a complex expression.
