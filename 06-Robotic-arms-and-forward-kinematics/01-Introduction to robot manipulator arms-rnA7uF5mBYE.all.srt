1
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:07,100
在这个讲座中，我们将讨论机器人手臂。
In this lecture, we are going to talk about robot arms.

2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:10,900
特别是，我们将讨论机器人关节之间的关系
In particular, we are going to talk about the relationship between the joints in a robot's

3
00:00:10,900 --> 00:00:14,250
手臂和机器人末端执行器的姿势。
arm and the pose of the robot end effector.

4
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,550
因此，当我用自己的手臂移动各种关节时，我们可以说是结束的姿势
So as I've moved the various joints in my own arm we can say that the pose of the end

5
00:00:18,550 --> 00:00:20,169
我的手臂变了，对吗？
of my arm changes, right?

6
00:00:20,169 --> 00:00:24,710
所以我们要做的是如何对通常包含的机器人手臂起作用
So what we're going to do is how this works for a robot arm which typically comprises

7
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:26,520
一些关节。
a number of joints.

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:31,489
在机器人的手臂中，它们变化，它们具有不同数量的关节，一些机器人手臂可能具有
In a robot's arm, they vary, they have different numbers of joints, some robot arms might have

9
00:00:31,489 --> 00:00:36,120
只有3个关节，一些机器人手臂可能有6个关节，有些可能有10个关节，可能有
only 3 joints, some robot arms might have 6 joints and some might have 10 joints, could have

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,449
100个关节。
a 100 joints.

11
00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:40,800
机器人手臂还有两种不同类型的关节。
There are also two different sorts of joints that robot arms have.

12
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,410
有些关节被称为棱柱关节。
There are joints that are called Prismatic joints.

13
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:45,980
这些是滑动或伸长的关节。
These are joints that slide or elongate.

14
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:50,920
并且有关节是旋转关节，就像我自己手臂上的关节一样。
And there are joints that are rotating joints, like the joints that I have in my own arm.

15
00:00:50,920 --> 00:00:55,260
所以我们称这种旋转关节为旋转关节和滑动或伸缩
So we call these sort of rotating joints Revolute joints and the sliding or telescoping

16
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,510
我们称之为棱柱关节。
joints we called Prismatic joints.

17
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:02,130
因此，这里有一些存在的不同类型的机器人手臂的照片。
So here are some pictures of a number of different types of robot arms that exist.

18
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:07,330
这只是存在于其中的非常大量机器人手臂的非常小的样本
This is just a very small sample of a very very large number of robot arms that exist within

19
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,330
世界。
the world.

20
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:12,000
我们将研究其中的一些示例，查看它们，查看数字
We are going to work through some of these examples, look at them, look at the number

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,549
他们拥有的关节，他们拥有的不同类型的关节，然后继续工作
of joints that they have, the different types of joints that they have and then work on

22
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:22,100
数学描述，关节角度与数学关系
the mathematical description, the mathematical relationship between the joint angles and

23
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:24,120
机器人末端效应器的姿势。
the robot end effector pose.
