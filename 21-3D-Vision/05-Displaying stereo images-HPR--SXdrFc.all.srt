1
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:08,440
如果我们有立体声对，则对应于左眼的图像和对应的图像
If we have a stereo pair, an image that corresponds to the left eye and an image that corresponds

2
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:13,920
在右眼，如果我们能够提出一种机制来指导这两者
to the right eye, if we can come up with a mechanism for directing those two slightly

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:20,980
不同的图像到各自的眼睛，然后我们有一个非常，非常生动的三维感
different images to the respective eyes, then we have a very, very vivid sense of the three-dimensionality

4
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:26,599
这是3D电影，3D电视等的基本原理。
of the scene and this is the underlying principle of 3D movies, 3D television and so on.

5
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:31,240
这是人类最长时间着迷的东西。我真的很喜欢这个
It's something human beings have been fascinated with for the longest time. I really love this

6
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:36,399
这部电影的海报来自1950年代的电影院。它向我们展示了那里
movie poster in this scene from a cinema back in the 1950's. It shows us that there’s

7
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:41,969
这种长期的人类对3D电影的迷恋。这不是最近的现象。技术
this long term human fascination with 3D movies. It's not a recent phenomenon. The technology

8
00:00:41,969 --> 00:00:47,539
不断变化，但基本原则完全相同。根本问题
keeps changing, but the underlying principle is exactly the same. The fundamental problem

9
00:00:47,539 --> 00:00:52,160
我们需要解决的是如何将不同的图像分成左眼和右眼？
we need to address is how do we get different image into our left eye and our right eye?

10
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,030
让我们来看看多年来开发的一些技术。
Let’s have a look at some of the technologies that have been developed over the years.

11
00:00:56,030 --> 00:01:01,559
为了再现我们在日常生活中获得的真实生动的3D感知，我们
In order to reproduce the really vivid 3D perception that we get in everyday life, we

12
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:07,030
需要使用一些相当精细的机制来人为地重建这种效果。
need to use some rather elaborate mechanisms to recreate that effect artificially.

13
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:14,790
所以第一个可能是从上个世纪初回来的，这个设备的作用是什么
So the first one is back from probably early last century and what this device does is

14
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,950
拍摄对应于来自左眼的图像和拍摄的另一图像的图像
takes an image which corresponds to an image from the left eye and another image taken

15
00:01:19,950 --> 00:01:22,720
从对应于右眼的位置。
from a position that corresponds to the right eye.

16
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,180
然后这个镜头机制将左图像发送到我的左眼和右图像
Then this lens mechanism here sends the left image into my left eye and the right image

17
00:01:28,180 --> 00:01:33,990
进入我的右眼所以如果我把它拿到脸上，我会看到一个非常生动的立体感
into my right eye. So if I hold this up to my face, I see a really vivid three-dimensional

18
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:38,790
100多年前拍摄的场景的代表。
representation of the scene that was captured more than 100 years ago.

19
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:42,439
这是第一种立体镜，这些东西真的很受欢迎
This is the first kind of stereoscope and these things were really, really popular in

20
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:49,210
20世纪初。因此，该技术的稍微更现代的版本是来自
the early 1900s. So a slightly more modern version of that technology is something from

21
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:54,729
20世纪60年代，这一个在一小块纸板上有许多立体图像对
the 1960s and this one has a number of stereo image pairs on a little piece of cardboard

22
00:01:54,729 --> 00:01:59,009
还有一点点击，所以我可以更方便地从一张图片移动到另一张图片。
and a little clicker so I can move from one picture to the other much more conveniently.

23
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:05,509
如果我再次把握住这一点，我会对我正在看的场景产生非常生动的3D感知。
If I hold this up to my head, again, I get a very vivid 3D perception of the scene that I’m looking at.

24
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,739
另一种为左眼和右眼提供不同图像的方法是什么
Another approach to providing different images into the left and right hand eyes, what’s

25
00:02:10,739 --> 00:02:15,129
称为浮雕技术，你看红色和蓝色的立体图像
called the Anaglyph Technique and you look at an anaglyph image through red and blue

26
00:02:15,129 --> 00:02:20,870
眼镜。会发生什么是左图像以红色和右手图像打印
glasses. What happens is that the left image is printed in red and the right-handed image

27
00:02:20,870 --> 00:02:26,340
用蓝色印刷，戴上这些过滤后的眼镜，左边的图像就会出现
is printed in blue and by putting on these filtered glasses, the left image comes through

28
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:30,930
红色滤镜进入我的左眼。它不通过蓝色滤镜。所以我的右眼
the red filter into my left eye. It does not pass though the blue filter. So my right eye

29
00:02:30,930 --> 00:02:35,480
没有看到。对于右手图像，以蓝色打印的图像通过
doesn't see that. For the right-hand image, the one that’s printed in blue, comes through

30
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:40,140
蓝色过滤到我的右眼，但没有进入我的左眼。所以，如果我把它放在和
the blue filter into my right eye but not into my left eye. So if I put this on and

31
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:45,430
查看网页上的印刷立体图像或立体图像，例如，NASA有
look at a printed anaglyph image or an anaglyph image on a webpage, for instance, NASA has

32
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:50,700
很多火星的立体图像，我们得到一个非常非常生动的3D感觉。
lots of anaglyph images of Mars, we get a very, very vivid 3D sensation.

33
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:56,970
这只是NASA收集的3D立体图像的一张图片。最近的火星
This is just one image from NASA’s collection of 3D anaglyph images. The most recent Mars

34
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:02,000
流浪者都携带相当复杂的立体视觉系统，图像被传回
Rovers all carry quite sophisticated stereovision systems and the images are transmitted back

35
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,000
到地球，由美国国家航空航天局处理并变成浮雕形式，并通过他们的网站提供。
to Earth, processed by NASA and turned into anaglyph form and made available through their website.

36
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:12,330
我们没有得到的是一个非常完整的颜色表示，因为我们是
What we don’t get though is a very full representation of the colour because we’re

37
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:16,659
通过红色和蓝色眼镜看着它。所以它看起来有点单色但是3D
looking at it through red and blue glasses. So it looks a bit monochromatic but the 3D

38
00:03:16,659 --> 00:03:21,300
感知真的很生动。如果你有一副立体眼镜，
perception is really quite vivid. If you’ve got access to a pair of anaglyph glasses,

39
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:25,920
这些是配有红色和蓝色镜片的眼镜，你可能有兴趣抓住它们，放上它们
these are glasses with the red and blue lenses, you might be interested to grab them, put them

40
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:31,680
然后看看下面几张图片。它们包含一些非常生动的三维内容。
on and have a look at these next few images. They contain some very vivid three-dimensional content.

41
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:38,080
绘制3D坐标框架的工具箱功能具有立体模式。如果我们打电话给
The toolbox function that draws 3D coordinate frames has an anaglyph mode. If we call the

42
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:45,920
我们之前见过的trplot函数，它将以90度的旋转传递
trplot function which we've seen before, it will pass in a rotation of 90 degrees around

43
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:52,320
X轴，这是我们想要显示的坐标系。我们通过3D图
the X axis so that’s the coordinate frame that we want to display. We pass the 3D plot

44
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,720
选项，如果我通过我的立体眼镜看到这一点，我会得到一个非常逼真的3D印象。
option and if I view this through my anaglyph glasses, I get a very realistic 3D impression.

45
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,560
我实际上看到Z轴有点出现在屏幕外面。
I actually see that Z axis coming out of the screen somewhat.

46
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:09,760
另一种技术和你在3D电影中看到的技巧，你可以看到重力或阿凡达，霍比特人的东西
Another technique and one you see in 3D movies, you can see Gravity or Avatar, Hobbit, something

47
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:15,360
像这样，你戴上这样的眼镜，剧院里发生的事情就是左手
like that, and you put on glasses like this, what happens in the theatre is the left-hand

48
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,480
图像是用光投射的，但它可能在垂直方向上也是偏振的
image is projected with light but it’s polarized perhaps in the vertical direction and that

49
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:25,760
光线通过这个滤光片，让偏振光进入我的右眼
light goes through this filter which lets through polarized light into my right eye

50
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:30,880
但是没有进入我的左眼，因为这个滤镜在水平方向上是偏振的。
but not into my left eye because this filter is polarized in the horizontal direction.

51
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:37,760
右手图像是通过此滤镜进行垂直偏振投影的
The right-hand image is projected with a vertical polarization comes through this filter but

52
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:42,880
不要进入这个过滤器。所以当我把它放在电影院的头上时，我看到了一个非常好的
not into this filter. So when I put this on my head in the cinema, I see a really wonderful

53
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:48,640
被拍摄的场景的3D五颜六色的表示法。
3D colourful representation of the scene that was filmed.

54
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:54,560
对于家庭使用，使用三维电视，技术有点不同。
For home use, with three-dimensional TV’s, the technology is a little bit different.

55
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,000
我们使用的是这些液晶快门眼镜。现在发生的是电视
What we use are these liquid crystal shutter glasses. What happens now is that the television

56
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:07,040
每秒约100次呈现左右图像。我们留下了图像，
presents the left and right images sequentially about 100 times per second. We have left image,

57
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:12,000
右图像，左图像，右图像和这些眼镜中的镜头同步
right image, left image, right image and the lenses in these glasses are synchronized with

58
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,960
电视，所以当投影左图像时，这个镜头变得清晰，正确，这个
the TV so when the left image is projected, this lens becomes clear and the right, this

59
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:23,520
一，是不透明的。所以我只看到左眼的左图。然后1/100秒，
one, is opaque. So I only see the left image in my left eye. Then 1/100th of a second later,

60
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,320
正确的图像投射在电视上;这个镜头变黑了，这个很清楚。所以
the right image is projected on the TV; this lens goes black and this one goes clear. So

61
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:33,600
有了这些，我得到了一个非常生动，又多彩，三维的表现形式
with these on my head, I get a very vivid, again colourful, and three-dimensional representation

62
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,960
通过电视的场景。
of the scene through the TV.

63
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:44,640
最后的方法是不要试图使用彩色眼镜，过滤眼镜和
The final approach is to do away with trying to use colour glasses, filtered glasses, and

64
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:49,440
戴在我头上的眼镜，将左右图像直接投射到我的眼睛里。
shuttered glasses on my head and to project the left and right image directly into my eyes.

65
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:55,200
因此，在某些方面，它是像这样的旧立体观众的高科技模拟
So in some ways it’s a high-tech analog of the old stereoscopic viewers like this

66
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,960
一个和这一个。所以这里是最先进的头戴式显示器。如果我把它放在我的身上
one and this one. So here is the state-of-the-art head-mounted display. If I put this on my

67
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,120
头部，左侧图像通过这个镜头直接投射到我的左眼和眼睛
head, the left image is projected through this lens directly into my left eye and the

68
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,760
右手图像通过这个镜头直接投射到我的右眼。
right-hand image is projected through this lens directly into my right eye.

69
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:13,280
我们所看到的所有技术都要求我们在头上戴上东西
All of the techniques that we’ve looked at require us to wear something on our head

70
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:17,760
这并不总是很方便。也许我们没有特定的眼镜
and that’s not always very convenient. Maybe we don’t have the particular glasses to

71
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:22,720
手或者我们发现它妨碍了我们的日常生活。
hand or maybe we find that it gets in the way of our everyday life.

72
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:28,160
所以在尝试创建立体声效果时需要做很多工作
So there’s been quite a bit of work in trying to create the stereo effect without needing

73
00:06:28,320 --> 00:06:33,440
你有什么想法，所以最近的一项创新就是所展示的技术
to have anything on your head, so one fairly recent innovation is the technology shown

74
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,920
这里有图解。它要求你的头部距离大约正确
diagrammatically here. It requires that your head is approximately the right distance away

75
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:43,840
从屏幕上看，有一个透镜系统折射左手的光线
from the screen and there is a system of lenses which refract the light from the left-hand

76
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,800
左眼大致方向的图像和右手图像被折射
image in the general direction of your left eye and the right-hand image is refracted

77
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,680
在你的右眼的大方向。
in the general direction of your right eye.
