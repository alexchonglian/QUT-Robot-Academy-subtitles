1
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:08,510
让我们总结一下讲座的要点。当我们拍摄场景的图像时，这是一个视角
Let's summarize the main points from the lecture. When we take an image of a scene, it's a perspective

2
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:11,940
投影，深度信息已丢失。
projection, and the depth information has been lost.

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:19,039
人类使用许多技巧或视觉提示来恢复缺失的深度信息。
Human beings use a number of tricks or visual cues to reinstate that missing depth information.

4
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,830
我们使用的提示取决于环境和距离。它在我们的范围内吗？
The cue that we use depend on the circumstance and also on the distance. Is it within our

5
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:27,550
个人空间还是走向地平线？
personal space or is it out towards the horizon?

6
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:31,620
我们使用的一种特别重要的技术，以及许多其他动物也是如此
A particularly important technique that we use, and so do many other animals, also it

7
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:37,100
将被机器人使用是一种称为双目视差的技术。这依赖于
will be used by robots is a technique called binocular disparity. And that relies on the

8
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:44,210
从不同的有利位置拍摄的同一场景的图像之间的细微变化。
small subtle changes between images of the same scene taken from different vantage point.

9
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:49,350
这是一个立体图像对的例子，我们可以看到左手图像和
Here's an example of a stereo image pair and we can see between the left hand image and

10
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:53,629
右手图像与我们用左眼和右眼看到的相对应
the right hand image to correspond to what we would see with our left eye and our right

11
00:00:53,629 --> 00:00:58,359
眼睛。一般来说，这两个场景看起来非常相似，但如果我们在那里看得更仔细
eye. In general these two scenes look very similar, but if we look more carefully there

12
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:03,680
它们之间存在一些微妙但重要的差异，这是微妙的差异
is some subtle but important differences between them, and it's these small subtle differences

13
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:08,930
这允许提取有关这个世界三维结构的信息。
that allows to extract information about this three dimensional structure of the world.

14
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:13,100
就像我们有两只眼睛一样，我们可以制造这种紧凑型装配的立体相机
Just as we have two eyes, we can build this stereo camera which is a compact assembly

15
00:01:13,100 --> 00:01:19,250
它实际上包含两个独立的摄像头和已知的pi距离。一个重要的
that contains effectively two independent cameras and known distance of pi. An important

16
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:25,890
立体视觉中的概念是不一致的。如果我们在左图中识别出一个点并找到
concept in stereovision is disparity. If we identify a point in the left image and find

17
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:30,610
右图中的相同点看​​起来有点偏向左侧，
the same point in the right image it will appear to have shifted somewhat to the left,

18
00:01:30,610 --> 00:01:33,869
而左移我们称之为差距。
and that leftward shift we refer to as disparity.

19
00:01:33,869 --> 00:01:39,290
重要的是，差异是距离的函数。所以对于一个靠近我们的物体，那里
Importantly, disparity is a function of distance. So for an object that's close to us, there

20
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:44,210
是一个很大的左移，一个很大的差距，在那里很远的地方有一个
is a large leftward shift, a large disparity, where something that's far away has got a

21
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:45,799
差距较小。
smaller disparity.

22
00:01:45,799 --> 00:01:51,759
因此，如果我们可以产生差异，那么使用立体视觉的几何，我们可以联系起来
So if we can make the disparity, then using the geometry of stereovision, we can relate

23
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,250
与物体距离的差异。使用这两个图像来计算差异，和
the disparity to the distance to the object. Use the two images to compute disparity, and

24
00:01:57,250 --> 00:01:59,619
从那，然后我可以计算Z.
from that, then I can compute Z.

25
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:05,250
计算差异并非微不足道。对于左手图像中的每个像素，我取一个正方形
Computing disparity is not trivial. For every pixel in the left hand image, I take a square

26
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:10,599
围绕它的像素窗口，用于搜索右侧相同的像素图案
window of pixels surrounding it within search for that same pattern of pixels in the right

27
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:15,790
手形图像，这涉及进行大量的图像比较。这是模板匹配
hand image, and that involves making a lot of image comparisons. It's the template-matching

28
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:17,459
我们之前看过的问题。
problem that we looked at earlier.

29
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:22,160
因此，给定场景的左图像和右图像，我可以计算每个像素，
So given a left image and a right image of a scene, I can compute at every single pixel,

30
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,569
视差，我可以将其显示为视差图像或视差图
the disparity, and I can display that as a disparity image or a disparity map, and in

31
00:02:27,569 --> 00:02:32,510
一个视差图，如果它们在附近就会很亮，如果它们更远，它们会变暗
a disparity map, things are bright if they're near and they are darker if they are further

32
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:37,690
远。相反的是，如果我有一个立体声对，两个图像从略有不同
away. The converse is that if I have a stereo pair, two images taken from slightly different

33
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:43,340
观点，如果我可以将这些图像呈现给我的左眼和右眼，我会有一个非常的
viewpoints, if I could present those images to my left and right eye, I will have a very

34
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:49,360
生动的场景三维感，非常非常强烈的深度感。
vivid sense of the three dimensionality of the scene, a very, very strong sense of depth.

35
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:53,550
人类长期以来一直对3D视觉的想法非常着迷
Human beings have been fascinated with the idea of 3D vision for a long, long time, and

36
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:58,000
我们讨论了一系列可以执行此功能的技术。
we discussed an array of technologies, which can perform this function.
