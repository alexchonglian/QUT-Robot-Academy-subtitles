1
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:08,050
我们可能会从人类如何解决这个问题中获得灵感;我们非常好
We might take some inspiration for how human beings solve this problem; we're very good

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:13,370
在三维世界中理解和运作。事实上人类使用
at understanding and operating in the three dimensional world. In fact human beings use

3
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:19,289
大量不同的技巧，技巧，有时称为视觉线索，要理解
a large number of different techniques, tricks, sometimes called visual cues, to understand

4
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:21,010
三维结构。
three-dimensional structure.

5
00:00:21,010 --> 00:00:26,420
在这篇特别的论文中已经确定了其中的九篇。不同的线索运作
Nine of them have been identified in this particular paper. Different cues operate in

6
00:00:26,420 --> 00:00:30,929
不同的距离制度。认为有一些在我们的武器中是有效的
different distance regimes. Thought there are some that are effective within our arms

7
00:00:30,929 --> 00:00:36,489
到达，一些有效达数十米，有些是有效的，直到地平线，
reach, some are effective up to tens of meters and some are effective right out to the horizon,

8
00:00:36,489 --> 00:00:39,379
距离很多公里。
a distance of many kilometres.

9
00:00:39,379 --> 00:00:44,280
让我们来看看其中的一些视觉线索。最简单的是遮挡，和
Let's have a look at some of these visual cues. The simplest of all is occlusion, and

10
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,250
此信息来自另一个对象前面的对象。我们可以告诉这里
this information comes from what object is in front of another object. We can tell here

11
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:54,329
那只猫在砖门柱前面，因为猫阻挡了一些遮挡了一些
that the cat is in front of the brick gatepost because the cat blocks out of obscures some

12
00:00:54,329 --> 00:01:00,309
那个门柱和鲜花都在猫的前面，因为它们阻挡了一些猫。
of that gatepost and the flowers are in front of the cat because they block out some of the cat.

13
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,549
另一个重要提示是视野中的高度。看着这个我们可以看到一棵树和
Another important cue is height in the visual field. Looking at this we can see a tree and

14
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,450
我们知道树很重要。但是在这个特定的图像中，树看起来并不像
we know a tree's a pretty big thing. But in this particular image the tree does not look

15
00:01:10,450 --> 00:01:15,170
那么大，所以我们认为这棵树必须走很远的路。
that big, so therefore we figure that the tree must be a long way away.

16
00:01:15,170 --> 00:01:20,570
我们也有相对的大小。我们这里有很多树。在我们的大脑中可能存在
We also have relative size. Here we have a number of trees. In our brain there's probably

17
00:01:20,570 --> 00:01:24,070
某种逻辑说这些是树木，树木都是一样的
some sort of logic that says that these are trees, trees are all going to be the same

18
00:01:24,070 --> 00:01:30,130
因此，这棵看起来比另一棵树大的树必须离我们最近。
size, so therefore, this tree which looks bigger than the other tree must be closest to us.

19
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:36,340
在这些引人注目的图片中，我们的大脑暂时混淆了。这需要一点时间
In these eye catching pictures, our brain is momentarily confused. It takes a moment

20
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:40,210
让我们弄清楚接近相机的小东西是什么
for us to figure out what are the small things that are close to the camera and what are

21
00:01:40,210 --> 00:01:43,409
远离相机的大件物品。
the large things that are far away from the camera.

22
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:47,869
这是沙漠中的一块大石头的照片，只是看着它，这是相当难的
Here's a picture of a large stone in the desert and just looking at it, it's rather hard for

23
00:01:47,869 --> 00:01:53,340
我们要以任何绝对的方式来衡量，这块石头有多大，我们可以打破这种错觉
us to gauge in any sort of absolute way, how big this stone is and we can break the illusion

24
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:57,840
通过介绍我们知道的尺寸;一双手指，我们可以挑选这块石头
by introducing something whose size we know; a pair of fingers and we can pick this stone

25
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:03,439
我们可以把它与它更着名的大哥哥，世界上最大的石头，
up and we can compare it to its more famous big brother, the largest stone in the world,

26
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,619
在澳大利亚的中心叫乌鲁鲁。
called Uluru in the centre of Australia.

27
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:14,980
在这里，我们看到一种非常非常强大的错觉。但是看起来没什么关于这个房间的。
Here we see a very, very powerful illusion. But nothing about this room is, as it seems.

28
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:22,080
一开始，地板不平坦。现在跟着我，看看它的样子
For a start the floor is not flat. Now follow me in and see what it looks like from the

29
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:28,910
内。时钟实际上不是圆的;如果我们看看那些我们看到的方形地砖
inside. The clock is not actually round; if we look at those square floor tiles we see

30
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:33,980
他们实际上并不是正方形的。房间的角落不是直角。
that they are not actually square. And the corners of the room are not right angles.

31
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:39,500
房间的整体几何形状已经设计出来，因此从这个特定的角度来看
The whole geometry of the room has been contrived, so that from this one particular viewpoint

32
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:43,640
它看起来像一个普通的房间。
it looks like an ordinary room.

33
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:47,690
我们用来估算距离的另一种技术称为“纹理密度”，这是一个很好的例子
Another technique we use to estimate distance is called "Texture Density" and a good example

34
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:53,410
在这条砾石路上可以看到它。近距离我们可以看到各个部分
of it is seen here in this gravel path. Up close we can see the individual pieces of

35
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:59,290
砾石和越来越远的距离，砾石碎片在图像中变得越来越小。
gravel and at increasing distance the pieces of gravel get smaller and smaller in the image.

36
00:02:59,290 --> 00:03:04,989
近距离纹理非常粗糙，随着我们走得更远，纹理变得更加精细
Up close the texture is quite coarse and as we go further away the texture becomes finer

37
00:03:04,989 --> 00:03:11,090
更精细，所以在我们的眼睛和大脑中，我们正在观察纹理和制作的大小
and finer, so in our eyes and our brain, we're looking at the size of a texture and making

38
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:14,269
关于距离如何相关的一些假设。
some assumptions about how that relates to distance.

39
00:03:14,269 --> 00:03:18,980
我们在非常大的距离上使用的技术称为空中透视。这个
A technique that we use over very, very large distances is called aerial perspective. This

40
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,610
利用距离为千米级的物体，
exploits the fact that objects that are at large distances of the order of kilometres,

41
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:26,860
变得不那么明显;更朦胧。
become less distinct; more hazy.

42
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:31,769
一个非常重要的暗示是双眼差异，我们将更多地谈论它
A really important cue is binocular disparity and we're going to talk much more about it

43
00:03:31,769 --> 00:03:37,819
在这个讲座中。这是从两个场景的两个视图得到的信息
in this lecture. This is the information that’s derived from two views of the scene from two

44
00:03:37,819 --> 00:03:41,930
不同的观点;我们的左眼和右眼，这是一种非常的技术，
different viewpoints; our left eye and our right eye and it's a technique that is very,

45
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,459
广泛用于动物。
very widely used in animals.

46
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:51,299
我们的眼睛包含一个镜片，我们大脑中有一个相当自主的部分负责保持
Our eye contains a lens and  there’s  a fairly autonomous part of our brain is responsible for keeping

47
00:03:51,299 --> 00:03:55,650
那个镜头聚焦了，所以如果我们正在寻找近距离的东西，那么这部分就是我们的
that lens focused, so if we're looking at something that's up close, this part of our

48
00:03:55,650 --> 00:03:59,629
大脑将调整镜头的形状，以便我们可以专注于该物体。
brain is going to adjust the shape of the lens so that we can focus on that object.

49
00:03:59,629 --> 00:04:05,169
如果物体离得更远，那么镜头的形状将会改变以专注于那个。
If the object is further away, then the shape of the lens is going to be changed to focus on that.

50
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:11,159
我们可以从这个肌肉中获取信息，并将其作为距离的代表
We can take information from this muscle and use that as a proxy for the distance of the

51
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:17,199
宾语。我们的视觉系统还有另一个相当自治的部分，它负责
object. There is another fairly autonomous part of our visual system, which is responsible

52
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:22,720
用于控制我们的眼睛指向的方向。当物体靠近我们的脸时，
for controlling direction in which our eyes point. When an object is close to our face,

53
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,979
我们的眼睛聚集在那个特定的物体上。如果我们获取有关方向的信息
our eyes converge on that particular object. If we take information about the direction

54
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:34,499
那些是眼睛指向的，我们可以对物体进行三角测量，这是一种推断其距离的方法。
that are eyes are pointing, we can triangulate to the object and that is a way of inferring its distance.

55
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:39,240
我们使用的最终技术称为“运动视角”，就像我在移动一样
The final technique that we use is called "Motion Perspective" and that is as I'm moving

56
00:04:39,250 --> 00:04:43,290
通过这个世界，靠近我的物体似乎移动得很快，
through the world, objects that are close to me, appear to be moving quite quickly,

57
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,930
而远处的物体似乎移动得慢得多。
whereas objects that are far away, appear to move much more slowly.
