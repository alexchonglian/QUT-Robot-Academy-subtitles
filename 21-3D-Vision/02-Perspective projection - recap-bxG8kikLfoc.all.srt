1
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:08,940
我们在之前的讲座中谈过透视投影。这是转型
We've talked in earlier lectures about perspective projection. This is the transformation of

2
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:14,150
将三维世界中的点分成二维图像。并涉及损失
points in a three-dimensional world into a two-dimensional image. And involves the loss

3
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:19,980
它会导致诸如在三维中平行的线条等人工制品的尺寸
of a dimension it leads to artefacts such as lines which are parallel in the three-dimensional

4
00:00:19,980 --> 00:00:26,019
世界似乎聚集在二维图像或三维投影中
world appearing to converge in the two-dimensional image or projection of that three-dimensional

5
00:00:26,019 --> 00:00:26,820
世界。
world.

6
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:32,390
这里的另一个例子是一堆平行线，平行的三个树干似乎会聚
Another example here a bunch of parallel lines, parallel three trunks which appear to converge

7
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:38,719
在某一点上。我们早就谈到了针孔成像模型。我们有一个三维的
at a point. We talked early on about the pinhole imaging model. We have a three-dimensional

8
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:45,980
场景和它投射成二维图像。透视没有独特的反转
scene and it projects into a two-dimensional image. There is no unique inverse of the perspective

9
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:54,050
投影。任何数量的不同三维模型都将导致完全相同的二维模型
projection. Any number of different three-dimensional models will lead to exactly the same two-dimensional

10
00:00:54,050 --> 00:01:00,910
投影。缺乏独特的逆是透视投影的重要结果。
projection. The lack of a unique inverse is really important consequence of the perspective projection.

11
00:01:01,300 --> 00:01:06,119
对于机器人来说，了解三维世界非常重要。机器人需要
For robotics, knowledge of the three-dimensional world is really important. A robot needs to

12
00:01:06,119 --> 00:01:11,189
知道它想要掌握的物体有多远。移动机器人需要知道是否
know how far away is the object that it wants to grasp. A mobile robot needs to know whether

13
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:15,710
它前面的空间可以自由驱动，或者那里是否有障碍物。
the space in front of it is free to be driven in or whether there is an obstacle there.

14
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:20,110
因此，我们在本次讲座中可以发现的重要话题是我们如何恢复第三个问题
So the important topic that we can uncover in this lecture is how do we recover the third

15
00:01:20,110 --> 00:01:25,610
尺寸。当我们捕获图像时，在透视投影过程中丢失了这一点。
dimension. That’s been lost in the perspective projection process when we capture an image.
