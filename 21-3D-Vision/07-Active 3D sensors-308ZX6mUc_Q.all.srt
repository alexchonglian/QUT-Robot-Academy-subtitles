1
00:00:03,260 --> 00:00:07,910
立体声不是机器人可用于确定其3D结构的唯一技术
Stereo is not the only technique that a robot can use to determine the 3D structure of its

2
00:00:07,910 --> 00:00:13,679
世界。这是一个非常熟悉的设备;它是MicrosoftKinect传感器。这有时候
world. This is a very familiar device; it's the Microsoft Kinect Sensor. This is sometimes

3
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:20,109
称为RGBD相机，它是一个传感器，可以在每个像素处返回红色值，
called an RGBD camera that is it's a sensor that returns you at each pixel, the red value,

4
00:00:20,109 --> 00:00:26,050
绿色值，蓝色值和深度。所以，我们之前谈到了彩色飞机
the green value, the blue value and the depth. So, we talked earlier about color planes in

5
00:00:26,050 --> 00:00:32,349
一个图像。Kinect传感器返回带有4个平面的图像，R，G，B和D.Kinect
an image. The Kinect Sensor returns an image with 4 planes, R, G, B and D. The Kinect

6
00:00:32,349 --> 00:00:37,559
包含2个完全独立的子系统。第一种是相当传统的颜色或
contains 2 quite separate subsystems. The first is a fairly conventional color or

7
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:44,390
RGB相机。第二部件是激光图案投影仪。所以，这实际上是省略，
RGB camera. The second component is a laser pattern projector. So, this is actually omitting,

8
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:49,340
一个红外光模式到现场，然后，有一个红外摄像头
a pattern of infrared light onto the scene and then, there is an infrared camera which

9
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:55,039
正在观察该图案并从图案的观察中，它可以确定三维
is observing that pattern and from the observation of the pattern, it can determine 3-dimensional

10
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,059
结构体。这种模式是什么样的？它的外观
structure. What does this pattern looks like? It's looks

11
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:02,840
非常斑点，它非常接近随机的点状图案。
pretty speckly, It’s pretty close to a random pattern of dots.

12
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,850
Kinect传感器所做的是利用一种称为结构化的非常经典的原理
What the Kinect Sensor does is exploit a very classical principle called structured

13
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:13,010
光。我想在这里做的是说明经典结构光的原理
light. What I want to do here is to illustrate the principles of a classical structured light

14
00:01:13,010 --> 00:01:16,990
传感器。此处的灰色框表示Kinect传感器
sensor. The grey box here represents the Kinect Sensor

15
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:22,299
我们有一个距离传感器一定距离的物体。我们有一台相机
and we have an object at some distance away from the sensor. We have a camera which is

16
00:01:22,299 --> 00:01:27,229
这里用针孔相机模型表示，后面有一个图像平面，我们有
represented here by a pin hole camera model with an image plane behind it and we have

17
00:01:27,229 --> 00:01:33,509
一个发射光线的激光投影仪。那些光线与物体和形状相交
a laser projector which emits a fan of rays. Those rays intersect the object and forms

18
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:38,240
物体上的光点。相机观察那些光点并形成一个图像
spots of light on the object. The camera observes those spots of light and forms an image which

19
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:43,189
是那些斑点在物体上的投影。我们只是制作一个临时副本
is a projection of those spots on the object. Let's just make a temporary copy of where

20
00:01:43,189 --> 00:01:47,670
那些斑点在图像平面上。现在，我们将考虑对象已经移动
those spots are on the image plane. Now, we're going to consider that the object has moved

21
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:52,210
离相机越远，我们重复这个过程。激光投影仪发射
further away from the camera and we repeat the process. The laser projector emits the

22
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:57,850
相同的激光束风扇。在物体上形成斑点。针孔相机观察到了这一点
same fan of laser beams. Spots are formed on the object. Pinhole camera observes that

23
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:04,560
我们在图像平面上看到一个投影。如果我们加回前一个图像平面投影
and we see a projection on the image plane. If we add back the previous image plane projection

24
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,379
我们之前说过，我们可以看到点的图案已经移动了。有一个垂直位移
which we say before, we can see that the pattern of dots has moved. There is a vertical displacement

25
00:02:11,379 --> 00:02:15,250
或与物距成比例的差异。
or a disparity that is proportional to the object distance.

26
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:21,660
因此，这是结构光的基本原理。现在，我们可以添加一些额外的测量
So, this is the fundamental principle of structured light. Now, we can add some additional measurements

27
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:26,410
这里。我们有一条基线，它是激光投影仪中心之间的距离
here. We have a base line which is the distance between the centre of laser projector and

28
00:02:26,410 --> 00:02:29,550
相机的中心。相机有一个焦距和物体
the centre of the camera. The camera's got a focal length and the object

29
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:35,160
是在距离z。现在，我们可以写出所有这些数量和差异之间的关系
is at a distance z. Now, we can write a relationship between all of these quantities and the disparity

30
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:38,420
与物距z成反比。
is inversely proportional to the object distance z.

31
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:43,379
所以，这并不是Kinect的工作原理，但它是一个非常相似的原理。在
So, this is not exactly how the Kinect works but it's a very similar principle. On the

32
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:46,970
Kinect传感器本身，基线则是中心之间的距离
Kinect Sensor itself, the base line then is the distance between the centre of the

33
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:51,819
激光图案投影仪和红外摄像机的中心。另一个原则是
laser pattern projector and the centre of the infrared camera. Another principle is

34
00:02:51,819 --> 00:02:55,950
什么叫飞行时间相机，我们在这里看到的是相机镜头
what's called the time of flight camera and what we can see here is a camera lens in the

35
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:01,300
中间和两侧，有2个相当高功率的发光阵列
middle and on the either side of that, there are 2 arrays of quite high power light-emitting

36
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:06,430
二极管。这些二极管不会将散斑图案投射到场景上。他们提供一般
diodes. These diodes don't project a speckle pattern onto the scene. They provide general

37
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:10,690
场景的整体照明。这个原理就是这样的。该
overall illumination of the scene. The principle works something like this. The

38
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:15,530
被发射的光以某种相当高的频率被调制并被反射
light that's being emitted is modulated at some quite high frequency and is reflected

39
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:20,440
关闭物体并由相机拾取。因此，光的调制频率可能
off the object and picked up by the camera. So, the modulation frequency of light might

40
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:26,659
像10或20兆赫兹。如果我们根据时间绘制光的强度，
be something like 10 or 20 megaHertz. If we plot the intensity of a light against time,

41
00:03:26,659 --> 00:03:32,659
红色的出射光和蓝色的入射光，我们看到入射光是
the outgoing light in red and incoming light in blue, we see that the incoming light is

42
00:03:32,659 --> 00:03:36,379
相对于出射光稍微延迟。
slightly delayed with respect to the outgoing light.

43
00:03:36,379 --> 00:03:42,780
有一个相移。所以，有一个延迟T.距离与
There is a phase shift. So, there's a delay of T. The distance is proportional to the

44
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,340
输出光和入射光之间的相位差。之间的关系
phase difference between the outgoing and the incoming light. The relationship between

45
00:03:47,340 --> 00:03:53,629
这里给出距离和时间延迟T，其中C是光速。光速
distance and the time delay T is given here where C is the speed of light. Speed of light

46
00:03:53,629 --> 00:03:57,120
是一个非常大的数字，意味着时间变化非常小。
is a very big number that means that the time shift is very small.

47
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,670
通常，它是纳秒的量级。这个过程在每一个都被复制
Typically, it's of the order of nano seconds. This process is replicated at every single

48
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:08,090
场景中的像素。因此，我们需要一种非常特殊的成像传感器。一个不仅仅是
pixel in the scene. So, we need a very special sort of imaging sensor. One that's not just

49
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:13,629
响应入射光的强度，但响应相位的像素
responsive to the intensity of the incoming light but a pixel that is responsive to phase

50
00:04:13,629 --> 00:04:16,780
转移。因此，这些相机需要非常特殊的感应
shift. So, these cameras require very special sensing

51
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:22,620
芯片通常没有特别高的分辨率，可能是64乘64像素或
chips and typically, don't have particularly high resolution, maybe 64 by 64 pixels or

52
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:29,060
128x128.这种传感器和Kinect传感器的一般缺点
128 by 128. A generic disadvantage of this kind of sensor and also the Kinect Sensor

53
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:34,210
是因为他们依靠将光投射到场景上。这意味着它们不起作用
is that they rely on projecting light onto the scene. This means that they don't work

54
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:39,440
特别好的户外，你有一个非常明亮的太阳完全压倒了
particularly well outdoors where you've got a very bright sun completely overwhelms the

55
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,600
传感器试图投射到场景上的光线。
light that the sensor is trying to project onto the scene.

56
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:47,070
然而，它们在室内工作非常好，而且在晚上工作非常好
They do, however, work very very well indoors and they work very very well at night where

57
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:49,740
传统的相机什么都不会返回。
a traditional camera will return nothing.
