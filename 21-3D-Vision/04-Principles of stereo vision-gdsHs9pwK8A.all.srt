1
00:00:03,310 --> 00:00:07,879
我们来谈谈双目视差。正如我之前提到的，这是一种技术
Let's talk some more about binocular disparity. As I mentioned before it’s a technique that's

2
00:00:07,879 --> 00:00:13,349
通过动物非常普遍，它也是一种用于机器人的技术。
very widespread through animals and it's also a techniques that's used in robotics.

3
00:00:13,349 --> 00:00:17,020
尝试理解双眼视差原理的一个好方法就是看看这个
A good way to try and understand the principle of binocular disparity is to look at this

4
00:00:17,020 --> 00:00:22,859
非常老式的立体照片。这是一对相同场景的照片但是
very old-fashioned stereo photograph. It's a pair of photographs of the same scene but

5
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:27,150
每个图像都是从略微不同的视角拍摄的，这对应于
each image is being taken from a slightly different viewpoint and this corresponds to

6
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:30,289
我们的左眼和右眼的观点。
the viewpoint from our left eye and our right eye.

7
00:00:30,289 --> 00:00:35,450
它相隔8到10厘米，它们会给你一个非常不同的
This is separated by that 8 to 10 centimetres and they give you a very slightly different

8
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:40,149
世界观。对这张立体照片的初步检查表明没有
view of the world. Initial inspection of this stereo photograph indicates that there's not

9
00:00:40,149 --> 00:00:44,860
差别很大。如果我们放大这里的几个区域，我们会在左侧看到
much difference. If we zoom in on a couple of areas here, we see that in the left

10
00:00:44,860 --> 00:00:49,989
手形图像，有相当大的差距，实际上右手图像没有间隙。
hand image, there's quite a gap and there's in fact no gap in the right hand image.

11
00:00:49,989 --> 00:00:54,250
如果我们看一下图片的另一面，我们会看看这个板凳。它非常接近
If we look on the other side of the picture, we look at this bench. It's quite close to

12
00:00:54,250 --> 00:00:59,050
左图中图像的边缘，边缘之间有一点间隙
the edge of the image in the left picture and there is a bit of a gap between the edge

13
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:03,399
和右手图像中的板凳。这是图像中非常微妙的差异
and the bench in the right hand image. It's this very subtle differences in the image

14
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:09,220
从这两个观点中可以看出，这些观点为我们提供了非常生动的三维感知
taken from these 2 viewpoints that gives us this very vivid 3-dimensional perception of

15
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:12,350
我们周围的世界。
the world that's around us.

16
00:01:12,350 --> 00:01:18,560
立体视差的基本原理是图像取决于相机位置
The fundamental principle of stereo disparity is that the image depends on the camera position

17
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:24,520
我们可以很容易地证明这一点。如果我移动我的头，如果我翻译我的头
and we can demonstrate that pretty easily. If I move my head, if I translate my head

18
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:30,200
从右到左，世界上的一切似乎都转移到了世界
from the right through to the left then, everything that's in the world appears to move to the

19
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:35,530
对，但重要的是，像我这样的机器人在我身边的东西似乎在移动
right but importantly, things that are close to me like this robot here, appear to move

20
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:41,100
在我做这种转变时，图像中有很多。而像书柜那样遥远的东西，
a lot in the image as I do that shift. Whereas things that are far away like the bookcase,

21
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,180
似乎行动少得多。
appear to move much less.

22
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:49,920
人们一直很想拍摄立体照片很长一段时间。
The people have been interested in capturing stereo photographs for a very very long time.

23
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:55,979
这是我从1950年代发现的商用立体胶片相机的可爱照片。更多
This is a lovely picture I found of a commercial stereo film camera from the 1950's. A more

24
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:00,899
现代版的立体相机，这是一种这种类型的数字立体相机
modern version of a stereo camera, this is a digital stereo camera of this type that's

25
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:03,820
广泛用于机器人系统。
quite widely used for robotic systems.

26
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:07,719
现在让我们试着了解左手之间究竟有什么区别
Let's now try and understand what precisely are the differences between the left hand

27
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:12,770
图像和同一场景的右手图像。这是一对高分辨率的数码相机
image and the right hand image of the same scene. This is a pair of high-resolution digital

28
00:02:12,770 --> 00:02:15,310
一堆岩石的图像。
images of a pile of rocks.

29
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:19,720
我要从图像的左边画一条线到一个相当独特的线
I'm going to draw a line from the left hand edge of the image to a fairly distinctive

30
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:24,410
在其中一块岩石上划线，我将在右手绘制相同的长度线
blotch on one of the rocks and I'm going to draw the same length line in the right hand

31
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,379
图片。黄线已经走得太远，事实上，我们需要回去
image. The yellow line has gone too far to the right and in fact, we need to go back

32
00:02:28,379 --> 00:02:33,040
为了达到岩石上这个独特标志的距离。
the distance in order to get to this distinctive mark on the rock.

33
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,099
让我们在这里选择另一个与众不同的特色。所以，我要走了
Let's pick another distinctive feature at the back of the scene here. So, I'm going

34
00:02:36,099 --> 00:02:42,340
从左边缘到其中一个大块的边缘画一条黄线
to draw a yellow line from the left hand edge to the edge of one of the large blocks at

35
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:46,860
背部。我在右手图像中绘制了相同的线条，我们再次看到它超出了
the back. I draw the same line in the right hand image and again, we see that it's overshot,

36
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:53,620
相应的点，我需要回到距离，以达到相应的点。
the corresponding point and I need to go back the distance in order to get to that corresponding point.

37
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,380
我们注意到两件重要的事情首先，我们注意到右手图像中的点
We noticed 2 important things. First of all, we noticed that points in the right hand image

38
00:02:59,390 --> 00:03:04,819
这个水平位移被称为向左移动并且这个位移
are shifted somewhat to the left and this shift, this horizontal displacement is referred

39
00:03:04,819 --> 00:03:11,419
差距。我们还注意到，对于远离相机的点，移位较少。
to as disparity. We also note that the shift is less for points that are further away from the camera.

40
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:16,620
所以，在这里我们有一个立体相机，它正在观察一个物体，一个球，然后是
So, here we have a stereo camera and it's observing an object, a ball and that is at

41
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,190
距离相机的距离为Z.我们指的是立体相机的基线，那就是
distance Z away from the camera. We refer to the base line of the stereo camera, that's

42
00:03:21,190 --> 00:03:26,989
镜头中心与F之间的距离是镜头的焦距。我们
the distance between the centre of the lenses and F is the focal length of the lens. We

43
00:03:26,989 --> 00:03:29,569
假设两个镜头具有相同的焦距。
assume that both lenses have the same focal length.

44
00:03:29,569 --> 00:03:34,390
现在，这是这些数量之间非常简单的关系，也就是差异
Now, this is a very simple relationship between these quantities and that is that the disparity

45
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:40,230
与焦距和基线除以距离成比例。所以，如果我们知道的话
is proportional to the focal length and base line divided by the distance. So, if we know

46
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:45,250
焦距，我们知道基线，然后我们知道图像中的差异，我们
the focal length, we know the base line and we know the disparity in the image then, we

47
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:50,680
可以估计Z.这是机器人立体视觉的基本原理，
could estimate Z. This is the fundamental underlying principle of robotic stereovision,

48
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:57,320
有时它被称为计算立体声，而且隐含地，它就是我们自己的视觉系统中发生的事情。
sometimes it's called computational stereo and implicitly, it's what happens in our own visual system.
