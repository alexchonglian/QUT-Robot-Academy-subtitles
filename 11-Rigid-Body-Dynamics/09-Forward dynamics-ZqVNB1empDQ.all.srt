1
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,170
到目前为止，您应该非常熟悉这个表达式。这是僵硬的身体
This expression should be pretty familiar to you by this point. This is the rigid body

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:12,910
串联机器人机械手的运动方程。我们有一个惯性词;科里奥利
equations of motion of a serial link robot manipulator. We have an inertia term; Coriolis

3
00:00:12,910 --> 00:00:18,110
和向心词;重力项;机器人施加的扭矩;联合加速;和
and centripetal term; gravity term; the torque applied the robot; joint acceleration; and

4
00:00:18,110 --> 00:00:22,040
关节速度。该表达式也称为逆
joint velocity. This expression is also known as the inverse

5
00:00:22,040 --> 00:00:28,039
动力学。我们可以将其视为映射机器人Q，Q点的运动的函数
dynamics. We can think of it as a function that maps the motion of the robot Q, Q-dot

6
00:00:28,039 --> 00:00:33,890
和Q点圆点，需要施加到机器人关节的扭矩。我们采取
and Q-dot-dot, to the torque that needs to be applied to the robots' joints. We take

7
00:00:33,890 --> 00:00:39,500
这个表达并重新安排它。我们最终得到了Q-dot-dot的表达式，我们
this expression and re-arrange it. We end up with an expression for Q-dot-dot, and we

8
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:44,320
关于时间可以集成Q点点得到Q点，联合速度我们可以
can integrate Q-dot-dot with respect to time to get Q-dot, the joint velocity and we can

9
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,290
再次整合它以获得联合位置。这组方程称为
integrate it again to get the joint position. This set of equations is referred to as the

10
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:55,610
前进动态。这是一个映射我们施加到机器人的扭矩的功能
forward dynamics. This is a function that maps the torque that we applied to the robot

11
00:00:55,610 --> 00:01:02,440
到关节位置，速度和加速度。因此，这些前向动力学用于模拟
to the joint position, velocity and acceleration. So, these forward dynamics are used to simulate

12
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:06,940
机器人运动。如果我知道我将要应用于机器人操纵器的扭矩和力
robot motion. If I know the torques and forces that I'm going to apply to the robot manipulator

13
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:13,450
然后我可以计算Q，Q点和Q点点作为时间的函数。
and then I can compute Q, Q-dot and Q-dot-dot as a function of time.

14
00:01:13,450 --> 00:01:17,530
让我们看看我们如何使用前向动力学来模拟复杂的运动
Let's have a look at how we can use the forward dynamics to simulate the motion of a complex

15
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:23,850
像PUMA560这样的6轴机器人。我将首先加载PUMA560的型号
6-axis robot like the PUMA 560. I'm going to start by loading a model of the PUMA 560

16
00:01:23,850 --> 00:01:29,749
进入我的工作区，因为我们之前做了很多次，我将调用Simulink
into my workspace as we've done a number of times before and I'm going to invoke a Simulink

17
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:36,429
随机器人工具箱提供的模型，这就是它的样子。真是太棒了
model that is provided with the Robotics Toolbox, and this is what it looks like. It's quite

18
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:43,609
一个简单的模型。它包含一个没有库仑摩擦的机器人，并连接到动画
a simple model. It contains a robot with no Coulomb friction, and connected to an animation

19
00:01:43,609 --> 00:01:48,200
或绘图块。机器人由零扭矩驱动。所以如果你想象一个机器人
or plotting block. And the robot is driven by zero torques. So if you imagine a robot

20
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,900
坐在一个正常的配置，我关掉所有的关节扭矩，机器人正在进行
sitting in a normal configuration and I turn off all the joint torque, the robot is going

21
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:58,630
在自重下崩溃。所以，我可以运行该模拟器，我们在这里看到
to collapse under its own weight. So, I can run that simulator and here we see

22
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:04,080
PUMA机器人在重力作用下坍塌，并且由于关节摩擦，能量
the PUMA robot and it's collapsing under gravity, and because of the joint friction, the energy

23
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:08,299
迅速消散，机器人处于向下指向的状态。
is rapidly dissipated and the robot is left in a downward pointing configuration.
