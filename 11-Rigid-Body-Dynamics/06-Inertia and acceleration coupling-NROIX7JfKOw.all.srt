1
00:00:03,970 --> 00:00:07,920
接下来，我们将看一下惯性项。这是加速所需的扭矩
Next, we are going to look at the inertia term. That's the torque required to accelerate

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:12,650
手臂的关节。这就是这个术语。所以，我们将跨越其他两个。
the joints of the arm. That's this term here. So, we'll cross the other two out.

3
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:17,730
现在，我将计算机器人的惯性矩阵，这是另一种方法
Now, I'm going to compute the inertia matrix of our robot, and that's yet another method

4
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:24,269
在双链路机器人对象上，该方法被称为“惯性”和参数
on the two-link robot object, and the method is called "inertia" and the arguments to that

5
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:33,290
是机器人Q1和Q2的关节角度。而且，这里我们有2x2的惯性矩阵
are the joint angles of the robot Q1 and Q2. And, here we have the 2x2 inertia matrix of

6
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:38,650
我们的机器人再一次，我们可以看到它是运动学和动力学参数的函数
our robot. Once again, we can see that it is a function of kinematic and dynamic parameters

7
00:00:38,650 --> 00:00:44,380
一个机器人，它也是机器人配置的功能，我们可以看到
of a robot, and it's also a function of the configuration of the robot, and we can see

8
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:51,140
Q2的正弦和余弦出现在这个表达式中。这是我们两个链接的惯性矩阵
sine and cosine of Q2 appearing in this expression. Here is the inertia matrix for our two link

9
00:00:51,140 --> 00:00:55,490
机器人机械手。它是一个2x2矩阵，它是一个对称矩阵;这意味着这一点
robot manipulator. It's a 2x2 matrix and it's a symmetric matrix; and that means that this

10
00:00:55,490 --> 00:01:00,340
这里的术语与此术语相同。而且，我们可以看到惯性矩阵是完全的
term here is equal to this term here. And, we can see that the inertia matrix is quite

11
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:05,189
复杂而且不是常数。我们可以看到这个矩阵中的元素
complex and it is not constant. We can see that the elements in this matrix

12
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:10,260
是关节角度Q2的函数，以及机器人连杆的质量，运动学
are functions of the joint angles Q2, as well as the masses of the robot link, the kinematic

13
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:15,390
参数A1和A2，以及质心的位置，C2。我们可以把它写进来
parameters A1 and A2, and the position of the centre of mass, C2. We can write it in

14
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:22,130
简化形式，我们在主对角线上只有三个独特的元素，I11，I22，
simplified form where we have just three unique elements, I11, I22 on the principal diagonal,

15
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:27,260
和I12和I21在对角线上。而且，正如我刚才提到的，矩阵是对称的
and I12 and I21 on the opposite diagonal. And, as I just mentioned, the matrix is symmetric

16
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:32,280
所以I12等于I21。扭矩矢量作用于机器人的
so I12 equals I21. The vector of torques acting on the robot's

17
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:39,170
惯性矩阵乘以关节加速度矢量给出关节。现在，
joints are given by the inertia matrix multiplied by the vector of joint accelerations. Now,

18
00:01:39,170 --> 00:01:44,140
我们可以扩展它，我们现在可以突出显示对角线上的两个术语。
we can expand that out, and we can highlight now the two terms on the diagonal.

19
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,620
在之前的讲座中，当我们考虑机器人关节控制时，生活很简单。我们有
In the previous lecture when we considered robot joint control, life was simple. We had

20
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:52,409
电动机施加在关节上的扭矩与加速度之间的关系
a relationship between the torque that the motor applies to a joint, the acceleration

21
00:01:52,409 --> 00:01:58,320
一个关节和该关节的惯性。现在，我们可以看到事情并不完全
of a joint and the inertia of that joint. Now, we can see that things are not quite

22
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,630
如此直截了当我们可以看到扭矩1和扭矩之间存在关系
so straightforward. We can see that there is a relationship between torque 1 and the

23
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:09,099
关节1的加速就像我们在更简单的情况下一样。但我们现在也有这些
acceleration of joint 1 just like we had in the simpler case. But we now also have these

24
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:14,870
干扰扭矩。这意味着作用在接头1上的扭矩不仅归因于加速度
disturbance torques. That means that the torque acting on joint 1 is due not just to the acceleration

25
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:18,730
关节1，也是关节2的加速度。
of joint 1, but also to the acceleration of joint 2.

26
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:23,490
想象一下，关节1是静止的。它没有加速。联合控制是
Imagine for a moment that joint 1 is stationary. It's non-accelerating. The joint control is

27
00:02:23,490 --> 00:02:28,170
试图保持静止。如果第2关节开始加速，它将会发挥作用
trying to keep it stationary. If joint number 2 starts to accelerate, it's going to exert

28
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:33,220
关节1号上的扭矩，关节1电机控制器必须处理
a torque on joint number 1, which the joint 1 motor controller is going to have to deal

29
00:02:33,220 --> 00:02:37,670
用。它将不得不提出一些额外的扭矩，将其应用于电机停止
with. It's going to have to come up with some extra torque, apply it to the motor to stop

30
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:44,720
由于关节2的影响，关节1移动。我们将计算它的惯性
joint 1 moving, due to the influence of joint 2. We're going to compute the inertia of this

31
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:50,940
机器人数字。我们将使用惯性方法并计算它
robot numerically. We're going to use the inertia method and going to compute it for

32
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,300
关节角度零，零，这是惯性矩阵，我们可以看到它是对称的。
joint angle zero, zero, and this is the inertia matrix and we can see that it is symmetric.

33
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:02,290
这里的元素在这里等于这个元素。而且，只是为了提醒自己的配置
This element here equals this element here. And, just to remind ourselves of the configuration

34
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:07,840
这个机器人，我们将绘制它。它就是。所以，这是带有手臂的机器人
of this robot, we are going to plot it. There it is. So, this is the robot with its arm

35
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:13,920
完全伸出来。现在，我们可以做的是更改配置。所以，我要走了
fully outstretched. Now, what we can do is to change the configuration. So, I'm going

36
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:21,520
将机器人置于第二关节角度为90度的配置中。所以，
to put the robot in to a configuration where the second joint angle is 90 degrees. So,

37
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:27,730
现在机器人看起来像这样。而且，我可以计算这个新配置的惯性，
now the robot looks like this. And, I can compute the inertia for this new configuration,

38
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:32,650
0pi/2。并且，我们可以看到惯性矩阵的某些元素已经改变。
0 pi/2. And, we can see that some elements of the inertia matrix have changed.

39
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:36,800
事实上，他们已经减少了。并且，这里的元素，这是看到的惯性
In fact, they have been reduced. And, this element here, which is the inertia seen by

40
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,410
关节1减少了。那是因为关节2的质心现在更接近了
joint 1 is reduced. And that is because the centre of mass of joint 2 is now closer to

41
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:48,010
关节的旋转轴1.现在，我可以更进一步。我们来看看是什么
the rotational axis of joint 1. Now, I can bring that in even further. Let's see what

42
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:53,450
如果我将机器人放入第一个角度为0和第二个角度的配置中，看起来就好像
it looks like if I put the robot in to a configuration where the first angle is 0, and the second

43
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:59,769
关节角度等于pi或180度，手臂向后折叠，这样
joint angle is equal to pi or 180 degrees and the arm is folded back on itself, which

44
00:03:59,769 --> 00:04:03,180
实际上可能不是物理上可能的，但让我们一起工作。
may not actually be physically possible, but let's work with that.

45
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:12,061
现在，我可以看一下这种配置中的惯性，看看它进一步减少了。那是
Now, I can look at the inertia in this configuration and see that it is even further reduced. That's

46
00:04:12,061 --> 00:04:17,250
因为机器人的所有质量都尽可能接近旋转轴
because all the mass of the robot is as close as it possibly can get to the rotational axis

47
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:21,989
因此，如果我崩溃了这个数字，那么我们可以看到的是逐步的
of joint 1. So, if I collapse that figure, then what we can see is progressively the

48
00:04:21,989 --> 00:04:27,040
随着我们增加关节，惯性矩阵中元素的大小变得越来越小
magnitude of the elements in the inertia matrix become less and less as we increase joint

49
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,350
角度2.而且，这是我们将重新审视的主题
angle 2. And, this is a topic that we will revisit

50
00:04:30,350 --> 00:04:35,380
不久。联合控制系统的问题，当它必须处理惯性时
shortly. The problem for a joint control system, when the inertia that it has to deal with

51
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:37,879
随机器人的配置而变化。
varies with the configuration of the robot.
