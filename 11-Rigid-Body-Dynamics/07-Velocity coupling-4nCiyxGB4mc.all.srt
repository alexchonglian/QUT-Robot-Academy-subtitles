1
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:09,110
我们要看的最后一个术语是“C”，它代表科里奥利和
The last term we're going to look at is the term 'C' and it represents the Coriolis and

2
00:00:09,110 --> 00:00:14,110
存在于串行链接机器人操纵器内的向心扭矩。它通常被称为
Centripetal torques that exists within a serial link robot manipulator. It's often called

3
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:20,200
速度项是因为C矩阵乘以矢量Q点，即关节速度的矢量。
the velocity term because the C matrix multiplies the vector Q dot, the vector of joint velocities.

4
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:26,380
这是由于旋转关节引起的陀螺效应引起的扭矩
This is the torque that is due to gyroscopic effects due to rotating joints within the

5
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:30,910
机器人机械手。实际上有两种效果由矩阵C和C建模
robot manipulator. There are actually two effects that are modelled by the matrix C and

6
00:00:30,910 --> 00:00:35,750
这是以法国科学家，数学家科里奥利（Coriolis）命名的科里奥利效应
it's the Coriolis effect which is named after the French scientist, mathematician Coriolis

7
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:40,960
他在理解旋转参考系中发生的事情方面做了很多工作
and he did a lot of work on understanding what goes on in rotating reference frames

8
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,410
并且由矩阵C表示的另一个力是向心力矩。
and the other force represented by the matrix C are centripetal torques.

9
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:49,880
我们再一次用象征性地表示我们的两个链接机器人，这次我们要去
Once again we have our two link robot represented symbolically and this time we're going to

10
00:00:49,880 --> 00:00:55,790
研究科里奥利和向心力矩。这是使用名为coriolis的方法完成的
investigate the Coriolis and centripetal torques. And that's done using the method called coriolis

11
00:00:55,790 --> 00:01:04,269
对它的论证是关节角度，它们是关节角度和联合速度;Q1D和Q2D。
and the arguments to that are the joint angles, there they are and the joint velocities; Q1D and Q2D.

12
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:11,340
需要一点时间来计算，这是科里奥利和向心矩阵。
It takes a moment to compute and this is the Coriolis and centripetal matrix.

13
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:18,320
它是一个2x2矩阵，我们再次看到它包含了许多运动和动态
It's a 2 x 2 matrix and we can see, once again that it comprises a number of kinematic and dynamic

14
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:22,749
机器人的参数，我们也可以看到它是配置的一个功能
parameters of a robot and we can also see that it's a function of the configuration

15
00:01:22,749 --> 00:01:27,459
机器人有趣的是，在这种情况下，它只是Q2的一个功能。
of a robot. Interestingly, in this case it’s only a function of Q2.

16
00:01:27,459 --> 00:01:31,810
对于一个简单的2连杆机器人操纵器，C矩阵看起来像这样。我们可以
For a simple 2 link robot manipulator, the C matrix looks something like this. We can

17
00:01:31,810 --> 00:01:36,639
看到元素是关节角度的函数，在这种情况下只是一个关节
see that the elements are a function of the joint angle, in this case just a single joint

18
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:43,560
角度。关节2角度Q2以及两个关节Q1点和Q2点的速度。
angle. Joint 2 angle Q2 and also the velocities of the two joints Q1 dot and Q2 dot.

19
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:50,009
现在，由于科里奥利和向心效应的扭矩可以通过乘以得出
Now the torque, due to the Coriolis and centripetal effects can be derived by multiplying the

20
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,560
矩阵C由关节速度的向量组成，如果我们扩展出来，我们就有了表达式
matrix C by the vector of joint velocities and if we expand that out, we have the expression

21
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:02,529
科林奥利和向心谈判在联合1和联合2上行事。
for the Coriolis and centripetal talks acting on Joint 1 and acting on Joint 2.

22
00:02:02,529 --> 00:02:07,539
让我们考虑联合1没有移动的情况，即Q1点等于零
Let's consider the case where Joint 1 is not moving that’s Q1 dot is equal to zero but

23
00:02:07,539 --> 00:02:12,990
让我们说联合2正在移动，所以Q2点不等于零。然后虽然这个词
let's say that Joint 2 is moving so Q2 dot is not equal to zero. Then although this term

24
00:02:12,990 --> 00:02:19,200
这里等于零。这个术语在这里是有限的，即第2关节的运动
here is equal to zero. This term here will be finite, that is the motion of Joint 2 at

25
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,120
恒定速度将在关节1上产生扭矩，而这又是一种扭矩
constant velocity is going to induce a torque on Joint 1 and that's again something that

26
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,690
联合1运动控制器将不得不反对，必须反对
the Joint 1 motion controller is going to have to fight against, going to have to oppose

27
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:33,940
为了保持关节1静止。
in order to keep Joint 1 stationary.

28
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:39,130
同样地，我们可以看到，对于关节1，关节1的恒定速度运动正在进行
And similarly we can see that for Joint 2 constant velocity motion of Joint 1 is going

29
00:02:39,130 --> 00:02:44,870
引起关节2的科里奥利和向心效应。现在，如果我们看一下这些术语，
to induce a Coriolis and centripetal effect on Joint 2. Now if we look at these terms,

30
00:02:44,870 --> 00:02:50,140
我们可以看到它们中的一些是特定关节速度平方和的函数
we can see that some of them are a function of a particular joint velocity squared and

31
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:56,280
这些是向心式的谈话，其中一些是一个联合速度倍增的产物
these are the centripetal talks and some of them are a product of one joint velocity multiplied

32
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:02,130
通过不同的关节速度，这些是科里奥利术语。所以这个矩阵C已经有了
by a different joint velocity and these are the Coriolis terms. So this matrix C has got

33
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:07,140
一些术语是不同关节的速度的产物，一些是关节速度
some terms which are the products of velocities of different joints and some are joint velocity

34
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:10,069
平方，科里奥利和向心效应。
squared, Coriolis and centripetal effects.
