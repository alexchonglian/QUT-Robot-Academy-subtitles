1
00:00:03,149 --> 00:00:06,720
我们将再次查看递归Newton-Euler算法的结果。但
We're going to look at the results of the recursive Newton-Euler algorithm again. But

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:10,610
这一次，我们将使用MATLAB的计算机代数象征性地进行操作
this time, we're going to do the operations symbolically using MATLAB’s computer algebra

3
00:00:10,610 --> 00:00:14,089
能力。我们要做的第一件事就是带来
capability. The first thing we are going to do is to bring

4
00:00:14,089 --> 00:00:20,939
在两个链接机器人的模型中，这是带有后缀sym的mdl_twolink来指示
in a model of the two link robot, that’s the mdl_twolink with a suffix sym to indicate

5
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:26,500
它是一个象征性的模型。再一次，我们在我们的网站中创建了一个串行链接对象
that it is a symbolic model. And once again, we have a serial link object created in our

6
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,119
工作空间称为twolink。
workspace called twolink.

7
00:00:28,119 --> 00:00:32,700
因为我将使用符号而不是数字，我需要实际定义我的
Because I am going to work with symbols rather than numbers, I need to actually define my

8
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,380
变量提前。所以，我将定义一个名为Q1和Q2的符号变量。和
variables in advance. So, I'm going to define a symbolic variable called Q1 and Q2. And

9
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:46,810
Q1D和Q2D表示关节1和关节2的速度，Q1DD表示加速度
Q1D and Q2D to represent the velocity of joints 1 and joint 2 and Q1DD to represent the acceleration

10
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:51,780
关节1和关节2的加速度。

11
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:58,260
现在我已经拥有了，我可以像上次那样使用rne方法，我将要通过
Now that I have that, I can use the rne method just as I did last time and I'm going to pass

12
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,600
在作为符号变量Q1和Q2的关节角度中。我要传球了
in the joint angles which are the symbolic variables Q1 and Q2. I am going to pass in

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:10,140
作为符号变量Q1D和Q2D的联合速度，我将要通过
the, joint velocities which are the symbolic variables Q1D and Q2D and I'm going to pass

14
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:18,330
在关节加速度的符号变量中，即Q1DD和Q2DD。
in the symbolic variables for the joint acceleration which is Q1DD and Q2DD.

15
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:26,930
并且，我将把它保存到一个名为tau的变量中。我记得这样做。这里
And, I'm going to save this into a variable called tau. Do that while I remember. Here

16
00:01:26,930 --> 00:01:30,380
我们去。这是结果。所以，如果我看一下正在起作用的扭矩
we go. Here is the result. So, if I look at the torque that is acting

17
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:35,770
在第一个关节，这里我们有一个扭矩的象征性表达，它是一个非常
on the first joint, here we have a symbolic expression for that torque and it is a very

18
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:41,530
长而复杂的表达。我们可以看到有许多运动学参数
long and complex expression. We can see that there are a number of kinematic parameters

19
00:01:41,530 --> 00:01:48,901
在这里像A1和A2。我们可以看到有联合加速度，关节速度。我们
in here like A1 and A2. We can see there are joint accelerations, joint velocities. We

20
00:01:48,901 --> 00:01:55,409
可以看到G，重力加速度有三角项。有联合
can see G, the gravitational acceleration there are trigonometric terms. There are joint

21
00:01:55,409 --> 00:02:00,760
群众。有各种各样的东西。这是一个非常漫长而复杂的表达
masses. There is all sorts of stuff. It is a very long and very complicated expression

22
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:06,880
用于作用在我们的简单双连杆机器人的关节1上的扭矩。
for the torque acting on Joint 1 of our simple two link robot.

23
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:13,150
作用于关节2的扭矩，即肘关节机器人，是一种更简洁的表达方式。
The torque acting on Joint 2, that's the elbow joint robot, is a more concise expression.

24
00:02:13,150 --> 00:02:18,450
作用在机器人的第二关节上的力和扭矩较小。我们可以
There are less complex forces and torques acting on the second joint of robot. We can

25
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:23,189
看到这个非常复杂的表达。想象一下六连杆机器人会是什么样子。
see this very complex expression. Imagine what it will be like for a six-link robot.

26
00:02:23,189 --> 00:02:29,200
现在，我们可以分解和简化那些非常复杂的表达式
Now, it is possible to factorize and simplify those very complex expressions that we just

27
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:35,239
看着。特别是，如果我们以这种矩阵形式表达它。Tau是一个载体
looked at. In particular, if we express it in matrix form like this. Tau is a vector

28
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:41,230
施加的关节扭矩。Q，当然是我们的联合坐标，一般是联合

30
00:02:47,549 --> 00:02:54,260
关节坐标和Q点点是关节加速度。G是一个术语

31
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:59,959
表示由重力作用于机器人操纵器和重力引起的扭矩
represents the torque that's due to the gravity acting on the robot manipulator and gravity

32
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:06,400
仅是关节坐标Q的函数.M是惯性矩阵，它是一个函数
is a function only of the joint coordinates Q. M is the inertia matrix and it is a function

33
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:10,540
只有关节坐标乘以关节加速度。
only of the joint coordinates multiply by the joint accelerations.

34
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:16,200
这为我们提供了加速串行链接机械手所需的扭矩。C
This gives us the torque that's required to accelerate our serial link manipulator. C
