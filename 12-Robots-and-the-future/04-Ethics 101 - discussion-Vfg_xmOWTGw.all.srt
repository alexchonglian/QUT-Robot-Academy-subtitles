1
00:00:03,770 --> 00:00:08,900
彼得：我想我们都对道德是什么有一个相当朦胧的想法。我们相信本质上
Peter: I think we all have a fairly hazy idea about what ethics is. We believe intrinsically

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:13,920
道德是一件好事。我对这个主题的了解非常有限，所以我会
that ethics is a good thing. My knowledge of the topic is incredibly limited, so I'd

3
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:18,039
我想介绍我的同事教授道格贝克，他更了解道德而不是道德
like to introduce my colleague professor Doug Baker, who knows way more about ethics than

4
00:00:18,039 --> 00:00:19,039
我做。欢迎道格！
I do. Welcome Doug!

5
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:21,280
道格：谢谢你，彼得。很高兴来到这里。
Doug: Thank you, Peter. A pleasure to be here.

6
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:26,700
彼得：道格，我对道德是什么没有清醒的认识。当我听到道德这个词时，
Peter: So Doug, I don't have a crisp sense of what ethics is. When I hear the word ethics,

7
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:32,520
我想到各种各样的事情;是非，善与恶，道德，价值观，行为。
I think of all kinds of things; right and wrong, good and evil, morals, values, behaviors.

8
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,719
你能为我解开一些这些事吗？
Can you untangle some of these things for me?

9
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:43,730
道格：是的。我认为彼得，当我教授道德时，我想首先开始教授什么
Doug: Yes. I think Peter, when I teach ethics, I like to first start off with teaching what

10
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:44,829
道德不是。
ethics is not.

11
00:00:44,829 --> 00:00:45,680
彼得：好的。
Peter: Okay.

12
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,440
道格：要开始消极，通常这不是一件好事，但我开始吧
Doug: To start off on the negative, usually that's not a good thing, but I start off on

13
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:57,030
否定的。它不是什么;是不是价值观。这不是宗教。这是件事
the negative. What it is not; is that it's not values. It is not religion. It is something

14
00:00:57,030 --> 00:01:05,500
从根本上说，它构成了整个社会的基础，它是所有宗教的基础，它超越了文化。
fundamentally, that underlies all of society, it underlies all of religion and it transcends culture.

15
00:01:05,500 --> 00:01:11,280
彼得：所有社会，所有宗教，所有文化？这是一个全球性的事情？
Peter: So all societies, all religions, all cultures? It's a global thing?

16
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:18,109
道格：它的全球性。它实际上是道德哲学，它为我们提供了指导。伦理
Doug: Its global. It is actually the philosophy of morality and it offers us a guide. Ethics

17
00:01:18,109 --> 00:01:22,369
为我们提供正确的指导。
offers us a guide as to the right thing to do.

18
00:01:22,369 --> 00:01:23,729
彼得：好的。
Peter: Okay.

19
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:33,340
道格：所以，价值观是一个信仰的星座，是我们是谁，是它的混合体
Doug: And so, values are a constellation of beliefs, an amalgam of who we are, and it's

20
00:01:33,340 --> 00:01:40,099
具有文化特色的价值观及其具体情境。换句话说，其中的值
culturally specific values and it's contextually specific. In other words, the values within

21
00:01:40,099 --> 00:01:47,899
1800年的澳大利亚文化与现在澳大利亚文化的价值观完全不同。
Australian culture in say 1800 are quite different than the values in Australian culture now.

22
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:50,779
彼得：但随着时间的推移道德有变化吗？
Peter: But have ethics changed over the time?

23
00:01:50,779 --> 00:01:52,679
道格：不，但价值观会发生变化。
Doug: No, but values change.

24
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:55,039
彼得：所以这是一种解释？
Peter: So it's an interpretation?

25
00:01:55,039 --> 00:02:02,989
道格：价值观树立了文化的规范，它们是一种执行道德的方式。但
Doug: Values set the norms of the culture, and they are a way of enforcing ethics. But

26
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:09,050
正如我所说，伦理学超越了它们，超越了所有文化。因此，价值再次持续到
ethics transcends them, to all cultures as I said. So, values again are continuous to

27
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:15,070
时间，但这在道德方面没有变化。什么应该是正确的
time, but that doesn't change in terms of ethics. What ought to be the right thing to

28
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:19,780
做什么，做正确的事情是由道德推理决定的。
do, what is the right thing to do is determined by moral reasoning.

29
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:25,260
彼得：所以人们长期以来一直在思考道德，也许是最长的道德
Peter: So people have been thinking about ethics for a long, long time, maybe the longest

30
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,950
人们想过的活动或主题。他们都同意吗？
activity or topic that people have thought about. Do they all agree?

31
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:37,610
道格：没有。但是，请听，道德理论有一定程度。这是一个巨大的领域和方面
Doug: No. But, listen, there are degrees in ethical theory. It is a huge area and in terms

32
00:02:37,610 --> 00:02:43,150
我们如何以道德的方式进行，通常有两种不同的思想流派。有
of how we proceed ethically, there's generally two different schools of thought. There's

33
00:02:43,150 --> 00:02:50,220
目的论和那里的道义论，如果我们看看这两种不同的思想流派
teleology and there's deontology, and if we look at those two different schools of thought

34
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:55,740
在道德推理方面，他们会谈到我们应该如何进行以及我们应该如何进行
in terms of moral reasoning, they'd come to how we should proceed and how we ought to

35
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,790
行为不同。
act differently.

36
00:02:56,790 --> 00:02:59,500
彼得：好的，让我经历这两个。
Peter: Okay so run me through these two.

37
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:09,080
道格：好的。所以第一次目的论看好事，做正确的事;什么是
Doug: Okay. So first teleology looks at the good thing, the right thing to do; what's

38
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:16,290
好到最后，它看着获得好的过程，以及与之争论
good in the end, and it looks at the process of getting what's good, and the argument with

39
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:23,790
目的论是，我们通过做正确的事情并产生最大的东西来进入未来
teleology is, we proceed into the future by doing the right thing and producing the greatest

40
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:31,080
好。因此，它的论点是，它不是过程而是产品，而且它是
good. And so, the argument in it is, it's not the process but the product, and it's

41
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:37,390
也称为结果主义。就功利主义者边沁和米尔而言
also called consequentialism. And in terms of the utilitarians Bentham and Mill in the

42
00:03:37,390 --> 00:03:46,340
1840年代，1850年代和1860年代，功利主义通过观察引入了这一道德分支
1840's, 1850's and 1860's, utilitarianism is brought in this branch of ethics by looking

43
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:52,819
最大的好处是最大的。所以，无论你做什么，都应该建立最大的
at the greatest good for the greatest number. So, whatever you do should build the largest

44
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:56,390
幸福的程度，所以最终的结果是来了。
degree of happiness, so the end result is what comes.

45
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:59,319
彼得：那不是关于个人，而是关于更大的利益？
Peter: So it's not about the individual, it's about the greater good?

46
00:03:59,319 --> 00:03:59,720
道格：正确。
Doug: Correct.

47
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:00,120
彼得：好的。
Peter: Okay.

48
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:08,380
道格：是的，完全正确。因此，如果我们建造一座电力大坝，目标就是建设
Doug: Yeah, exactly right. So, if we build a dam for power, the objective is to build

49
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:16,590
为一个国家的工业化提供动力的工业水库，事实
an industrial reservoir for power for the industrialisation of a nation, and the fact

50
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:22,699
我们不得不搬出两百个农民或几个村民并不重要。
that we have to move out two hundred farmers or a couple of villagers doesn't matter.

51
00:04:22,699 --> 00:04:24,340
彼得：因为更大的好处？
Peter: Because of the greater good?

52
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,400
道格：重要的是。
Doug: It's what counts.

53
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:30,080
彼得：好的。因此，在工程术语中，您会说这将取决于您的成本函数。
Peter: Okay. So, in an engineering term then, you'd say that would depend on your cost function.

54
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,340
这取决于你施加在电力和村庄幸福的重量。
It would depend on the weights that you applied to electricity and to the happiness of the village.

55
00:04:35,349 --> 00:04:40,240
道格：当然。因此，它成为衡量市场和非市场变量的案例。
Doug: Absolutely. And so, it becomes a case of measuring market and non market variables.

56
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,499
但最大数量的最大好处通常是你在很多方面看到的论点
But the greatest good for the greatest number is often the argument you see in a lot of

57
00:04:44,499 --> 00:04:48,919
大型项目。那是的，我们知道，我们知道我们必须在这里影响你，我们知道这一点
mega projects. That, yeah we know, we know we have to affect you here and we know this

58
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:53,639
社区受到影响但是，对于更多的人来说，这很重要。
community's getting impacted but, for the greater number, it's important.

59
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:55,629
彼得：告诉我另一个分支。
Peter: Tell me about the other branch.

60
00:04:55,629 --> 00:05:08,479
道格：另一个分支真的看着这个过程。道义论是一个完整的思想领域，
Doug: The other branch really looks at the process. Deontology is a whole area of thought,

61
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:15,620
从不能开始向右前进，看着这个过程，
starting with can't and moving forward right through the rolls, that looks at the process,

62
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:21,990
而论证是过程与善是分开的。所以好的是分开的
and the argument is that the process and the good are separated. So what is good is separate

63
00:05:21,990 --> 00:05:24,379
从过程的正确性。
from the correctness of the process.

64
00:05:24,379 --> 00:05:25,509
彼得：你是怎么到达那里的？
Peter: It's how you get there?

65
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:25,999
道格：正确。
Doug: Correct.

66
00:05:25,999 --> 00:05:26,419
彼得：好的
Peter: Okay

67
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:35,020
道格：所以这个论点实际上是我们如何做到的，它是至关重要的，以及道德指导
Doug: So the argument is in fact how we do it, it's critical, and that moral guidance

68
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:37,909
至于我们如何做到这一点有所不同。
as to how we do it makes the difference.

69
00:05:37,909 --> 00:05:39,439
彼得：你能举个例子吗？
Peter: Can you give me an example.

70
00:05:39,439 --> 00:05:47,110
道格：所以在公众参与方面，这个论点是，例如，任何政府
Doug: So in terms of public participation, the argument is, for example, any government

71
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:54,330
实际上，当他们心中有一个大型项目时，请继续进行。
would actually, when they have a large project in their mind go ahead and do it in the past.

72
00:05:54,330 --> 00:06:00,110
但现在我们有一个过程，通过这个过程来告知公众，使公众融入社会
But now we have a process by which to inform the public, to integrate the public, to make

73
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:04,830
关于这是否是最佳途径，以及更多人参与的决定
the decisions as to whether this is the best path to go, and more people are involved in

74
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:09,680
决策过程，以及公众参与和利益相关者的参与
the decision making process, and as a result public participation and stakeholder participation

75
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:17,860
因此而蓬勃发展。但这个分支的关键-道义论;约翰罗尔斯
is bloomed as a result of this. But the key with this branch - deontology; John Rawls

76
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:24,559
可能是20世纪最着名的哲学家，真正看过一个理论
is probably the most well known philosopher of the 20th Century, really looked at a theory

77
00:06:24,559 --> 00:06:29,319
正义和论点是，这里重要的是对个人和我们的正义
of justice, and the argument was, what counts here is justice for the individual, and we

78
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:33,400
我们的决定基于什么是适合个人的，而不是伤害个人。
base our decisions on what's right for the individual and not to harm the individual.

79
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:38,749
彼得：好的，那么一个分支就是更大的好处，但是我们可能会定义其他分支
Peter: Okay so one branch then is the greater good of however we might define that, other

80
00:06:38,749 --> 00:06:41,309
分支对个人来说是最好的。
branch is what's best for the individual.

81
00:06:41,309 --> 00:06:42,069
道格：当然。
Doug: Absolutely.

82
00:06:42,069 --> 00:06:48,719
彼得：我可以挑选吗？这两种道德都没有比另一种好吗？
Peter: So I can pick and choose? No one of both ethics is better than the other?

83
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:53,139
道格：正确。你可以相应地证明它的合理性。例如，在你的结果主义中
Doug: Correct. And you can justify it accordingly. For example, in consequentialism when you

84
00:06:53,139 --> 00:07:02,210
看看积极的歧视，换句话说，首先是优先聘用
look at positive discrimination, in other words a preferential hiring of say, first

85
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:08,819
国家或原住民超过其他申请人，或雇用妇女超过其他申请人
nations or aboriginal people over top of other applicants, or the hiring of women over the

86
00:07:08,819 --> 00:07:15,639
男人最喜欢男人。现在的争论是积极的歧视是
top of men, in preference to men. Now the argument is that positive discrimination is

87
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:23,059
在结果主义论证中证明是合理的，因为过去存在问题
justified in a consequentialist argument, in that there has been problems in the past

88
00:07:23,059 --> 00:07:29,319
关于我们如何对待女性以及如何解雇她们。我们现在可以纠正这个问题
with respect to how we treated women and how we fired. We can rectify that in the present

89
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:36,119
特别注重雇用他们并违反正义原则，但是
by specifically focusing on hiring them and violating the principle of justice, but the

90
00:07:36,119 --> 00:07:39,099
最终的结果是，我们将有50％的女性在工作场所。
end result is that we'll have 50% women in the work place.

91
00:07:39,099 --> 00:07:39,639
彼得：是的。
Peter: Yeah.

92
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,819
道格：你和我在一起？所以这是一个结果论证。现在，牙医学家会冒犯他人
Doug: You're with me? So that's a consequentialist argument. Now a deontologist would take offence

93
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:50,919
因为你违反了公平。因此，一个结果主义者的观点
to that, because you're violating fairness. And so, a consequentialist's perspective then

94
00:07:50,919 --> 00:07:58,519
记住了最终的结果，并再次考虑到了更大的利益。所以你可以从双方争论。
has the end result in mind, and again the greater good in mind. So you can argue from both sides.

95
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:03,699
彼得：道格，所有这一切，我如何将道德思维付诸实践？
Peter: So Doug, given all of that, how do I put ethical thinking into practice?

96
00:08:03,699 --> 00:08:10,369
道格：没有公式，但所有道德准则都有一个基本的基础。
Doug: There's no formula but there's a fundamental kind of basis for all moral codes.

97
00:08:10,369 --> 00:08:11,349
彼得：好的。
Peter: Okay.

98
00:08:11,349 --> 00:08:18,860
道格：它再次取决于个人和个人的权利。首先是
Doug: It hinges around again, the individual and the rights of the individual. First there's

99
00:08:18,860 --> 00:08:25,189
自治的结构-个人自己选择而不是自己选择的权利
the construct of autonomy - the right of the individual to make their own choice and not

100
00:08:25,189 --> 00:08:31,169
违反这一点。其次，有一种男性的结构-没有伤害。
to violate that. Secondly, there's a construct of maleficence - to do no harm.

101
00:08:31,169 --> 00:08:32,039
彼得：好的。
Peter: Okay.

102
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:38,350
道格：这是围绕着医生的道德准则。它是围绕非恶意形成的。
Doug: And it's the ethical code that surrounds doctors. It's formed around non-maleficence.

103
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:45,040
然后是有益的，即帮助，帮助。其次，或者最后，就是这个
Then there's beneficence, which is to help, to aid. Secondly, or lastly, there's this

104
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:51,960
正义的概念和那是罗尔斯的方法。你必须公平。公平原则至关重要。
notion of justice and that's Rawls approach. You must have fairness. The fairness principle is critical.

105
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,600
彼得：公平是一个绝对的概念吗？
Peter: Is fairness an absolute concept?

106
00:08:54,600 --> 00:09:00,350
道格：是的，确实如此。如果你看一下功利主义理论和帕累托，它就可以被权衡
Doug: Yes, it is. And it can be weighed if you look at the utilitarian theory and Pareto

107
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:07,330
经济学-他们在这种结构中公平，在公平和不公平方面
economics - they lay fairness in that construct, in terms of what is fair and what isn't and

108
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:13,930
我们如何确定公平性。因此，它翻译，大部分伦理理论直接翻译
how do we determine fairness. So, it translates, much of this ethical theory translates directly

109
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:18,810
进入经济理论和功利主义理论。所以引入它是如此令人着迷
into economic theory and utilitarian theory. So it's fascinating how it's all brought in

110
00:09:18,810 --> 00:09:22,700
并通过它了解我们如何看待世界以及我们如何评估世界。
and through it into the how we see the world and how we evaluate the world.

111
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:27,380
彼得：所以这不仅仅是一些抽象的概念，它可以付诸实践而且是它的基础
Peter: So it's not just some abstract notion, it can be put into practice and it underpins

112
00:09:27,380 --> 00:09:29,800
我们社会中非常重要的事情。
really important things in our society.

113
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:34,580
道格：绝对是！没有什么比良好的道德理论更有用了。
Doug: Absolutely! There's nothing more applied than a good ethical theory.
