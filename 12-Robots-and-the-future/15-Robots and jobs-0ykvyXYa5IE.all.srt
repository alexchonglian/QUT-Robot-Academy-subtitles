1
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:08,510
在本节中，我想谈谈机器人和工作。每当我去公开场合
In this section I'd like to talk about robots and jobs. Whenever I go and give a public

2
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:13,869
谈论机器人技术，观众中的某个人总是问我机器人和工作。Arn't
talk about robotics, somebody in the audience always ask me about robots and jobs. Arn’t

3
00:00:13,869 --> 00:00:18,770
机器人会把人从工作中拿走？确实如此，机器人将把工作带走
robots going to take jobs away from people? And it's true, robots will take jobs away

4
00:00:18,770 --> 00:00:23,420
来自人民。但我相信人们不应该做的工作。那是因为那些
from people. But there are jobs that I believe people shouldn't do. And that's because those

5
00:00:23,420 --> 00:00:25,240
工作很危险。
jobs are dangerous.

6
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:30,140
因此，如果我们查看此处显示的数据，我们会查看每100,000人的死亡人数
So if we look at the data shown here, we look at the number of fatalities per a 100,000

7
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:35,510
在2个时间点记录了许多不同职业领域的工人。和我们
workers in a number of different occupational areas recorded at 2 points in time. And we

8
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,890
可以看到有一些行业真的很危险。人们可以去
can see that there are some industries, which are really quite dangerous. People can go

9
00:00:39,890 --> 00:00:44,489
在其中一个行业工作，晚上不回家，因为他们已经被杀了
to work in one of these industries and not come home at night because they've been killed

10
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,319
在工作中。而对我来说这是不可接受的。如果有危险的工作，那就应该
on the job. And to me that's non-acceptable. If there are dangerous jobs, then it should

11
00:00:49,319 --> 00:00:52,979
是机器而不是人类。
be machines doing work instead of humans.

12
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:57,249
我将重点关注采矿业，因为这是我花费更多的一个领域
I'm going to focus a bit on the mining industry because that's an area where I spent more

13
00:00:57,249 --> 00:01:03,019
10年来开发用于地下和露天采矿的各种机器人技术。
than 10 years developing various robotic technologies for underground and surface mining.

14
00:01:03,019 --> 00:01:07,500
让我们首先看看美国采矿业编制的一些死亡数据
Let's first of all look at some fatality data from the United States mining industry compiled

15
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,409
在大约100年的时间里。
over a period of about 100 years.

16
00:01:09,409 --> 00:01:16,320
线图显示了按生产标准化的死亡率。然后我们看到一个非常愉快的减少
The line graph show the fatality rate normalized to production. Then we see a very happy reduction

17
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,950
在那个死亡率。黑线是煤炭行业，红线是
in that fatality rate. The black line is for the coal industry and the red line is for

18
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:26,880
非煤炭工业，一般是服务采矿业务。他们往往更安全
non-coal industry which is generally service mining operations. They tend to be safer than

19
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,229
地下采煤。
underground coal mining.

20
00:01:29,229 --> 00:01:33,990
因此，随着时间的推移，已经有了相当大的改进。我们一如既往地观察
So while there has been a very considerable improvement over time. We observe just as

21
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:39,200
我们为道路交通事故造成的死亡率提高了稳定性
we did for road accident fatalities that the rate of improvement is plateauing and it's

22
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:44,770
没有平稳到零。它的平稳值高于零。所以有一些残余
not plateauing to zero. It's plateauing to a value above zero. So there is some residual

23
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:48,979
采矿作业中将发生的死亡率。
rate of fatality that will occur in mining operations.

24
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:54,049
尽管经过了100年的持续改进，我们仍然在努力争取这一速度
Despite 100 years of continuous improvement, we are really struggling to get this rate

25
00:01:54,049 --> 00:01:59,340
降到零。如果我们看看今天矿山发生的事故类型，我们就会看到
down to zero. If we look at the types of accidents that occur in mines today, we see that the

26
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:05,009
课程真的很多样化。其中一些是人类之间的不幸遭遇
courses are really quite varied. Some of them are unfortunate encounters between human beings

27
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:10,340
和机器，输送带和卡车等。其中一些是触电，人
and machines, conveyer belts and trucks and so on. Some of them are electrocutions, people

28
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:15,940
滑倒和摔倒，相对较少的人涉及人们被落石杀死，
slipping and falling, relatively few of them involved people being killed by falling rocks,

29
00:02:15,940 --> 00:02:21,600
这也许是大多数人认为在地下矿井中导致死亡的原因。
which is perhaps what most people would consider to be leading cause of death in an underground mine.

30
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:28,280
那么我们能做些什么呢？重要的是将人类从危险中移除
So what can we do about this? Well the important thing is to remove the human beings from hazardous

31
00:02:28,290 --> 00:02:32,520
的情况。如果你是这种类型的车辆，称为装载拖运装置或铲子电车
situations. Here is a type of vehicle called a load haul dump unit or a scoop tram if you

32
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:38,000
来自加拿大。它用于在地下矿井中运输矿石。曾几何时
come from Canada. And it's used to carry ore in an underground mine. Now once upon a time

33
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,310
这些机器都是由坐在这里的司机驾驶的。问题是这些机器
these machines were all driven by a driver who sat here. The problem is that these machines

34
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:48,800
进入矿井的危险区域。所以一些矿业公司现在做的就是去除
go in to dangerous parts of the mine. So what some mining companies do now is to remove

35
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,450
操作员到安全的远程位置。
the operator to a safe remote location.

36
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:56,800
在这里，操作员可以使用操纵杆控制机器，并且可以看到状态
Here the operator is able to control the machine with the joystick and she can see the status

37
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:02,010
通过相机的视图和车辆的位置叠加的机器
of the machine through a view of the camera and the position of the vehicle superimpose

38
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:06,440
在我的地图上。而那种态势感知信息来自各种各样的
on a map of the mine. And that situational awareness information is coming from various

39
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,130
适合机器的感官。
senses fitted to the machine.

40
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:13,900
所以我们现在看到的是做工作的人和工作地点之间的分离
So what we're seeing now is a separation between the person doing the work and the place where

41
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:19,400
工作正在进行中。在许多其他情况下也会发生这种情况。水下
the work is occurring. And this happens in many other situations as well. An underwater

42
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:24,290
在海底深处做一些任务的车辆。操作员很舒服
vehicle which is doing some task deep beneath the ocean. The operator is at some comfortable

43
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:30,250
船上的工作站。考虑一下火星机器人的情况。它正在做这项工作
workstation on board a ship. Consider the case of a Mars robot. It's doing the work

44
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:35,410
地球科学家和化学家在火星表面，而实际的地质学家和化学家
of geologist and chemist on the surface of Mars whereas the actual geologist and chemist

45
00:03:35,410 --> 00:03:39,090
坐在地球上的工作站。
are sitting at workstations on earth.

46
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,370
考虑一下我们之前看到的机器人手术的情况。外科医生正在做
Consider the case of robotic surgery that we look at earlier. The surgeons are doing

47
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,570
他们在工作站的工作在图片左侧的实际工作中，
their work at workstations on the left hand side of the picture where the actual work,

48
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:51,070
实际手术发生在患者体内。那就是
the actual surgery is occurring inside of the body of the patient. And that's being

49
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:57,010
由机器人完成。现在机器人通过电缆连接到工作站。所以
done by the robots here. Now the robots are connected to the workstations by cables. So

50
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,630
事实上没有理由说这些电缆不能再长一些了。事实上他们可能是
there's no reason in fact that those cables couldn't be longer. They could in fact be

51
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:05,270
洲际电信链接。这实际上是在证明。我们已经
an intercontinental telecommunications link. And this is actually being demonstrated. We've

52
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:10,650
让一个大陆的外科医生对另一个大陆的病人进行手术。
had surgeons on one continent performing an operation on a patient in another continent.

53
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:15,120
所以工人和工作地点现在非常明显。
So the worker and the place of work are now quite distinct.

54
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:20,620
传统上，工作一直在工作场所。工人一直在机器上
So traditionally, the work has been at the workplace. The worker has been on the machine

55
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:26,440
或直接控制机器。现在有了遥控技术，这是可能的
or controlling the machine directly. Right now with remote control technology, it's possible

56
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:32,060
工人可以远离机器。但是在未来我想会发生什么
that the worker can be remote from the machine. But in the future I think what's going to

57
00:04:32,060 --> 00:04:37,620
碰巧的是，机器将更加智能，他们将能够自己完成大量的工作。
happen is that the machine will be smarter and they'll be able to a lot of the work all by themselves.

58
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:44,080
因此，我们将转向一个工人将远程管理许多机器的情况。那
So we will move to a situation where one worker will be remotely managing many machines. That

59
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:48,220
意味着那些不喜欢的工人坚持传统意义上的机器
means that the worker who is not joy sticking the machine in the traditional sense they

60
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:52,620
给机器一个高级命令。他们说机器A就这样做了
giving a high level command to the machine. They are saying machine A go off and do this

61
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:58,680
任务。机器B关闭并执行此任务。机器C去做这个任务。如果其中一台机器
task. Machine B go off and do this task. Machine C go and do this task. And if one of the machines

62
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,030
遇到问题然后它会回到运营商那里。
has encountered a problem then it would come back to the operator.

63
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:04,490
机器B可能会回到操作员那里说：“我不知道怎么做这件事
Machine B may come back to the operator and say, "I don't know how to do this thing that

64
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:09,070
你已经让我这么做了。“因此，操作员可以给机器B一些更详细的说明。
you've asked me to do." So the operator can give machine B some more detailed instructions.

65
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:14,420
所以这就像人类经理管理一些人类工作者的方式。但现在我们有了
So it's like the way a human manager manages a number of human workers. But now we have

66
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:19,970
管理一些智能机器的人力资源经理。
a human manager managing a number of intelligent machines.

67
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:24,150
也许在中期的某个时候，机器将足够聪明，不需要
Perhaps sometime in the medium future, the machines will be smart enough not to need

68
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:30,460
人事经理。但是现在我们需要人类直觉，智慧和经验的结合
human managers. But right now we need a combination of human intuition, intelligence and experience

69
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:36,920
结合不懈的职业道德，机器人工人的不知疲倦和可靠性。
combined with the relentless work ethic, the tirelessness and the reliability of robotic workers.

70
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,530
因此，在未来，我相信工作将成为人类管理者和机器人之间的合作伙伴关系
So in the future I believe work will be a partnership between human managers and robot

71
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:46,690
工作人员。而这可能会带来相同或更高水平的生产力
workers. And what this enables is the same or greater level of productivity perhaps with

72
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:52,570
降低操作员技能水平。因为技能将被封装在机器人工作者中。
lower operator skill levels. Because the skill is going to be encapsulated in the robot worker.

73
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:56,740
机器人工作人员将进行详细的熟练工作，人力资源经理将继续
The robot worker is going to do the detailed skilful work and the human manager is going

74
00:05:56,740 --> 00:06:02,419
告诉机器人应该在哪里部署其特定技能。
to tell the robot where it should be deploying its particular skill.

75
00:06:02,419 --> 00:06:06,669
机器将受到更少的损害，因为它们将由计算机驱动
Machines are going to suffer much less damage because they're going to be driven by computers

76
00:06:06,669 --> 00:06:10,630
而不是人类。计算机将确保机器
rather than by human beings. The computers are going to ensure that the machines are

77
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:15,000
在他们的操作信封内安全驾驶。
driven safely and within their operational envelopes.

78
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,270
最后，我们将能够实现力量倍增。这意味着更多的工作
And finally we'll be able to achieve force multiplication. That means that more work

79
00:06:19,270 --> 00:06:24,290
将能够由更少的人完成，因为他们将得到机器人的协助。
will be able to be done by fewer people because they're going to be assisted by robots.

80
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:29,940
为了实现这一目标，我们需要在哪里之间需要高通信带宽
In order to achieve this, we're going to need high communications bandwidth between where

81
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:34,810
机器人正在做他们的工作，人类经理正坐在他们的工作站。
the robots are doing their work and where the human managers are sitting at their workstations.

82
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:41,590
我们需要机器具有一定程度的本地自治权，某种程度的本地自动化。
We're going to need the machines to have some level of local autonomy, some level of local automation.

83
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,300
我们将不得不采用系统方法来完成我们的任务;我们在哪里定位
We're going to have to take a system's approach to the way we do task; where do we situate

84
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:51,210
人们，我们在哪里定位机器人，我们应该将多少智能嵌入到机器人中
the people, where do we situate the robot, how much intelligence should we embed in the

85
00:06:51,210 --> 00:06:55,340
机器人，我们需要多少通讯。所以它将成为一种新的思维方式
robot, how much communications do we need. So it's going to be a new way of thinking

86
00:06:55,340 --> 00:06:58,730
关于工作场所以及人类和机器人如何相互作用。
about work places and how humans and robots interact.
