1
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:08,130
彼得：每当我在一个普通观众面前谈论机器人，某人时
Peter: Whenever I give a talk somewhere to a general audience about robots, somebody

2
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:13,519
总是问我关于工作的问题;机器人不会把我们的工作带走吗？和论点
always asks me the question about jobs; won’t robots take our jobs away? And the argument

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:19,780
我经常做的是'是的，他们会带走一些工作，这是不舒服的，
I usually make is 'yeah, they're going to take some jobs away and that's uncomfortable,

4
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:24,430
但另一种选择是，如果我们没有在工厂工作的机器人，我们可能就是这样
but the alternative is if we don't have robots working in factories, the likelihood is we

5
00:00:24,430 --> 00:00:27,080
将完全失去这个行业。
will lose the industry entirely.'

6
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,750
所以我们做了一些交易。我们将继续保持行业，例如，我们
So we're making a bit of a trade. We're going to keep the industry, for instance, we're

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,160
将汽车制造业保持在劳动力成本高的国家，并且这样做
going to keep manufacturing automobiles in a high labor cost country and it's going to

8
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,590
雇用一些人，它将采用一些税收，这将是一个巨大的打击
employ some people and it's going to employ some taxes and there's going to be a big knock

9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:46,500
关于经济利益，但是，是的，绝对会对就业产生一些影响。
on economic benefit, but yeah, absolutely, it will have some impact on jobs.

10
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,399
最近，关于所谓的新机器时代已有相当多的文章
More recently, there's been quite a bit written about the so-called new machine age where

11
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:58,200
整个工作岗位，不一定是手工劳动工作，很多所谓的知识工作者
a whole raft the jobs, not necessarily manual labor jobs, a lot of so-called knowledge worker

12
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:04,110
工作也许会消失，比如解释X光片并撰写财务报告。现在
jobs will perhaps disappear, like interpreting X-rays and writing financial reports. Now

13
00:01:04,110 --> 00:01:06,509
这些都是现在的工作。
these are jobs now that are on the line.

14
00:01:06,509 --> 00:01:13,000
曾经有一位非常着名的哲学家伏尔泰谈到了工作的美德
There's a once upon a time very famous philosopher, Voltaire, talked about the virtues of work

15
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:19,350
我们中的许多人定义自己或我们的身份，我们的自尊，这一切都包含在内
and many of us define ourselves or our identity, our self-esteem, it’s all wrapped up in

16
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:25,570
工作。因此，在我看来，这或许是我们今天所讨论的所有主题中最复杂的问题。
work. So this seems to me perhaps the most exquisitely complex of all the topics that we've talked about today.

17
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:28,330
道德对此有何看法？
What does ethics say about this?

18
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:40,260
道格：我们的身份被锁定在我们大多数人经常做的事情上。而我们的根本
Doug: Our identity is locked up in what we do often for most of us. And our fundamental

19
00:01:40,270 --> 00:01:46,369
引导我们大多数人的道德哲学来自约翰洛克的劳动理论。约翰
moral philosophy that guides most of us comes out of John Locke's theory of labor. John

20
00:01:46,369 --> 00:01:54,350
洛克的劳动理论是财产权的基础。而这本身就是这样
Locke's theory of labor is the foundation to the rights to property. And that in itself

21
00:01:54,350 --> 00:01:59,420
建立美国宪法的产权基础。
set up the property rights basis of the American Constitution.

22
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:05,780
因此，财产权以及我们如何定义自己以及如何定义我们的文化
So the rights to property and how we define ourselves and how we define our culture is

23
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:14,500
锁定了我们的工作。它在自由民主，劳动理论方面根深蒂固，
locked up in what we do. And it's entrenched in terms of liberal democracy, the labor theory,

24
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:22,620
和功利主义;所有这三种哲学观点都指导着我们如何设定价值观。
and utilitarianism; all three of those philosophical perspectives guide us in terms of how we set our values.

25
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:32,080
现在，对于取代人类的机器，你将对Luddite革命非常熟悉。
Now with respect to machines replacing humans, you'll be very familiar with the Luddite revolution.

26
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:32,980
彼得：当然。
Peter: Absolutely.

27
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,930
道格：在早期的工业革命中。
Doug: During the early industrial revolution.

28
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,300
彼得：有大锤子的家伙。
Peter: The guys with big hammers.

29
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:40,660
道格：是的。他们进去了，他们粉碎了所有的棉纺厂。我想这大约是1790年。
Doug: Yep. They went in and they smashed all the cotton mills. I think it's about 1790.

30
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,209
他们去了那里，因为他们害怕而去了棉纺厂的小镇
They went in there and just went to town on the cotton mills because they're afraid, and

31
00:02:44,209 --> 00:02:48,769
他们在这方面非常正确，棉纺厂将取代他们的工作。他们做到了。
they were quite right in this, that the cotton mills are going to replace their jobs. And they did.

32
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:56,870
当然，Luddites都很快就被吊死了。维多利亚时代的不当行为规则
Of course, the Luddites were all duly hanged very quickly. Victorian rules for misconduct

33
00:02:56,870 --> 00:03:02,019
这是世界上历史上最严重的一些，但感谢天堂，我们没有
were some of the most severe in the history in the world but thank heavens we don't have

34
00:03:02,019 --> 00:03:06,440
这么多艰难的法律了。
so many hard laws anymore.

35
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:13,450
但是Luddites有一个合理的立场。然而，自从机器以来，这一直伴随着我们
But the Luddites had a justified position. However, that's been with us since machines

36
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:19,760
和我们在一起，那种恐惧。天生担心我们不仅会失去工作，
been with us, that fear. That innate fear that we're going to lose not only our jobs,

37
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,660
但我们的身份和我们是谁。
but our identity and who we are.

38
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:29,209
彼得：自从工业化以来，创造了许多就业机会，然后就消失了。
Peter: And since industrialisation here, so many jobs have been created and then disappeared.

39
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:35,140
道格：正确。它似乎潮起潮落。我们的劳动力越来越多
Doug: Correct. It seems to ebb and flow. We're getting more and more people in the labor

40
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:40,580
市场。澳大利亚在过去50年中人口增加了一倍。我们有更多的人在工作。
market. Australia in the last 50 years has doubled in population. We have more people working.

41
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:47,060
所以我可能对此有点无知，但从我所看到的是我们适应。它的
So I might be a little ignorant on this, but from what I can see is that we adapt. It's

42
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:53,010
关于人类最有趣的事情之一，就是我们适应和适应的能力
one of the most interesting things about the human being, is our ability to adapt and to

43
00:03:53,010 --> 00:03:56,209
更改。而我们似乎正在这样做。
change. And we seem to be doing that.

44
00:03:56,209 --> 00:04:04,230
因此，这种对机器失去工作的天生恐惧似乎是没有根据的。然而，
And so, this innate fear of losing our jobs to machines seems to be unfounded. However,

45
00:04:04,230 --> 00:04:11,799
我明白了。在道德方面，实际上，这不是一个道德立场
I understand it. In terms of ethics, really, it's not an ethical position that you can

46
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:17,319
采取。我猜个人需要有自主权来选择并能够工作
take. I guess individuals need to have the autonomy to choose and to be able to work

47
00:04:17,319 --> 00:04:23,360
并且能够生活在自由的环境中并且能够访问这些资源
and to be able to live in a free environment and to have access to those resources, so

48
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:26,689
这在道德上非常重要。
that's very important ethically.

49
00:04:26,689 --> 00:04:31,710
但是机器将把它带走的论点，我已经看到了一些证据
But the argument that machines are going to take that away, I've seen some evidence of

50
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:39,169
它最近关闭了南澳大利亚的Holden工厂，但最底层
it recently with the closure of the Holden facilities in South Australia, but bottom

51
00:04:39,169 --> 00:04:42,409
现在我们正在谈论潜艇，我想，昨天的新闻？
line is - now we're talking about submarines, I think, yesterday on the news?

52
00:04:42,409 --> 00:04:42,849
彼得：是的。
Peter: Yep.

53
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:47,629
道格：并且可能将更多的工作整合到澳大利亚并将其发送出去
Doug: And integrating maybe more work back into Australia and send it off, putting it

54
00:04:47,629 --> 00:04:55,539
进入日本重新设计和重建在澳大利亚的潜艇。因此，它起伏不定。
into Japan for re-designing and rebuilding submarines back in Australia. So, it ebbs and flows.

55
00:04:55,539 --> 00:05:03,110
彼得：那么就个人而言，如果他们没有工作，那就是道德考虑
Peter: So in the case of an individual, if they don't have a job, the ethical consideration

56
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:07,270
这是我们是否会影响他们的自治。
here is whether we impinge on their autonomy.

57
00:05:07,270 --> 00:05:13,639
道格：是的，没错。在这种文化中有基本的权利可以拥有充实的生活。
Doug: Yes, correct. And there are basic right to have a fulfilled life in this culture.

58
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:18,419
彼得：但在我们的文化中，一个充实的生活通常包括一份工作。
Peter: But in our culture a fulfilled life usually includes a job.

59
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:25,979
道格：嗯，它包括工作权和获得工作和资源的权利。
Doug: Well, it includes the right to work and the right to have access to work and resources.

60
00:05:25,979 --> 00:05:26,930
是的，它确实。
Yes, it does.

61
00:05:26,930 --> 00:05:33,550
彼得：所以我们可以在人们头上盖一个屋顶，我们可以确保他们不饿
Peter: So we could put a roof over people's heads, we can make sure that they're not hungry

62
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:42,470
所以他们会在某种意义上照顾，舒服，但他们可能没有工作选择。
and so they would be in some sense looked after, comfortable, but they may not have the option of a job.

63
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:51,399
道格：是的。我认为更大的问题是，机器是否会夺走工作机会？换句话说，如果我们看一下......
Doug: Yeah. I think the bigger question is, are machines taking away jobs? In other words, if we look at…

64
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,869
彼得：总的来说。
Peter: In an overall sense.

65
00:05:52,869 --> 00:05:55,520
彼得：是的，他们会带走一些，但其他工作将会到来。
Peter: Yes, they're going to take away some but then other jobs are going to come.

66
00:05:55,529 --> 00:06:00,080
道格：其他工作将用机器创造，所以似乎有一个平衡点
Doug: And other jobs will be created with the machines, so there seems to be a balance

67
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:05,309
那里。和往常一样，这是一种平衡，我认为这是一种凝聚力
there. And as always, there's a balance, and I think that there's a cohesion in terms of

68
00:06:05,309 --> 00:06:09,699
创造就业机会和失去似乎正在努力的工作。我没有
the creation of jobs and the loss of jobs that seems to be working on. I don't have

69
00:06:09,699 --> 00:06:11,449
关于那个的统计数据但这将是一个有趣的...
stats on that but that would be an interesting…

70
00:06:11,449 --> 00:06:14,889
彼得：我的意思是，它已经消失了一百年或更长时间。
Peter: I mean, it's the way it's gone for hundred years or more.

71
00:06:14,889 --> 00:06:15,319
道格：当然，是的。
Doug: Absolutely, yeah.

72
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:20,969
彼得：问题在于我们是否会突然出现某种临界点
Peter: The issue is whether we're going to some kind of tipping point where suddenly

73
00:06:20,969 --> 00:06:27,860
不再持有，并且有一些书说这种情况，但我不认为
that no longer holds, and there is some books that say that that's case, but I don't think

74
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,119
我们-我不确定是否有人可以做出混合硬性或坚定的预测。
we- I'm not sure anyone can make a hybrid hard or firm prediction about that.

75
00:06:32,119 --> 00:06:36,679
道格：是的，所以我没有答案，因为如果是这样的话，让我们的项目......
Doug: Yeah, so I don't have an answer to that because if it's the case, let's project…

76
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:37,189
彼得：好的。
Peter: Okay.

77
00:06:37,189 --> 00:06:48,969
道格：如果是这样，比如100年，机器真的几乎取代了你和我。
Doug: If it's the case, say, in 100 years, that machines have really pretty much replaced you and me.

78
00:06:48,969 --> 00:06:49,469
彼得：是的。
Peter: Yup.

79
00:06:49,469 --> 00:06:54,539
道格：我们不再需要教授，我们在那里有一个忘记了更多的机器人
Doug: We don't need professors anymore, we've got an android there that forgot more about

80
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:59,649
比道格贝克所知道的道德规范，我们在这里有另一个道德，好吧，
ethics than Doug Baker will ever know, and we've got another one over here that, well,

81
00:06:59,649 --> 00:07:04,860
他将彼得·科克的大脑编入他的脑中，而他还有另外三个大脑
he's got Peter Corke's brain programmed into him and he's got about three more other brains

82
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:10,419
编入他的程序，他可以教所有关于机器人的东西。
programmed into him and he can teach everything there is about robotics.

83
00:07:10,419 --> 00:07:17,330
那么接下来的问题是，你和我这样的人呢？我们可能会这样做
So the question then is this, what are guys like you and me do? We'll probably be doing

84
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:27,669
但是我不确定是什么。那么问题就在于我们是否接管了这些工作
something but I'm not sure what. And the question then is if we have the jobs taken over by

85
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:34,339
机器，人类做什么？我们是否为此获得了价值，或者我们可能在年龄退休
machines, what do humans do? Do we get value for that or maybe we retire at the age of

86
00:07:34,339 --> 00:07:37,020
30，或许我们不工作？我不知道。
30, or maybe we don't work? I don't know.

87
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:41,679
彼得：我认为另一件事是我们长大了。我们谈到了那个人
Peter: Which is the other thing that I think is we grow up. We talked about that the people

88
00:07:41,679 --> 00:07:45,599
将会提前退休以及所有这些，而且这种情况也没有发生。
would be retiring earlier and all this, and that didn't happen either.

89
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:45,949
道格：不。
Doug: No.

90
00:07:45,949 --> 00:07:47,369
彼得：退休年龄正在上升。
Peter: The retirement age is going up.

91
00:07:47,369 --> 00:07:51,309
道格：是的，绝对的。是的，绝对是，它正在上升。我不知道那是什么。
Doug: Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, absolutely, it is going up. I don't know what that's about.

92
00:07:51,309 --> 00:07:54,959
彼得：不，但我认为这是一个坏主意。
Peter: No, but I think it's a bad idea.

93
00:07:54,959 --> 00:08:03,779
道格：那是真的。但我认为，就道德而言，我认为就是拿走工作
Doug: That's true. But I think that, in terms of ethics, the taking away of jobs, I think

94
00:08:03,779 --> 00:08:07,569
我们需要了解更大的图景以及所创造和所采取的措施的平衡
we need to look at the bigger picture and the balance of what's created and what's taken

95
00:08:07,569 --> 00:08:13,229
离开之前，我们可以做出这个论点。但它确实不是道德的论据。它
away before we can make that argument. But it really isn't an argument for ethics. It

96
00:08:13,229 --> 00:08:19,149
可以作为自治的论据，但总的来说，我不认为这是一个道德问题。一点也不。
can be an argument for autonomy but overall, I don't see that's an ethical issue. Not at all.
