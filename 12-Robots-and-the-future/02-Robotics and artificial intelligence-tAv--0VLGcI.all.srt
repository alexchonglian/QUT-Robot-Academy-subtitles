1
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:08,540
通常当我发表公开讲话时，观众中的某个人会问我人工智能
Often when I give a public talk, somebody in the audience asks me about artificial intelligence

2
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:13,040
这不是一个我觉得特别舒服的话题。我认为自己
and it's not a subject I feel particularly comfortable to talk about. I consider myself

3
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,430
机器人专家，也就是建造机器的人，而人工智能
a roboticist, that is, somebody that builds machines, whereas artificial intelligence

4
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:22,769
对我来说，这是一门完全独立的学科，是计算机科学中的一门子学科。
to me is a completely separate discipline, a sub-discipline within computer science.

5
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:29,509
当然，情报也是一个非常难以理解的概念，我认为也是如此
Intelligence, of course, is also a very difficult concept to understand and I think it also

6
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:35,320
与历史背景有关。回到第一讲，我们看了
has something to do with the historical context. Way back in lecture number one, we looked

7
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,660
在这张着名的消化鸭的照片。那个时候，人们认为这个
at this picture of the famous digesting duck. And at that time, people considered that this

8
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:46,010
机器具有逼真的特性。无论它是否聪明，我都不确定，但是
machine had life-like properties. Whether it was intelligent or not, I'm not sure, but

9
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:49,340
人们认为它很像生活。
people considered it to be very life-like.

10
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:55,460
后来出现了这些自动机，非常复杂的机器，看起来很聪明
Later on came these automata, incredibly intricate machines that could do seemingly intelligent

11
00:00:55,460 --> 00:01:00,190
的东西。也许在那个时候，人们会看着这些机器并考虑它们
things. And perhaps at that time, people would look at these machines and consider them to

12
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:05,140
聪明，因为他们做了智能生物或实体的各种事情，
be intelligent because they did the sorts of things that intelligent beings or entities,

13
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,080
比如人类，能够很容易地做到。
such as humans, are able to do quite readily.

14
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:15,220
在40年代末和50年代初期，WilliamGrayWalter建立了许多控制论设备，
In the late 40's and early 50's, William Grey Walter built a number of cybernetic devices,

15
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:20,940
最着名的是他的控制论乌龟。这是一台包含继电器和机器的机器
most famously his cybernetic tortoise. And this was a machine that contained relays and

16
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:22,820
真空管技术。
vacuum tube technology.

17
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:28,120
它能够展现寻光行为。所以，如果你在地板上放一盏灯，这只乌龟
It was able to exhibit light-seeking behavior. So if you put a light on the floor, this tortoise

18
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:33,830
当它到达那里时会朝着光线移动并停下来。所以再一次，这似乎是一个
would move towards the light and stop when it got there. So again, this was a seemingly

19
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:40,549
智能行为。在许多非常简单的生物体中可以看到这种寻光行为。
intelligent behavior. This light-seeking behavior is seen in many very simple organisms.

20
00:01:40,549 --> 00:01:47,810
因此，当时，40年代末，50年代初期，这样的事情被认为是聪明的。
So at the time, late 40's, early 50's, something like this was perceived as being intelligent.

21
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,049
从我们目前的观点来看，它看起来相当原始和悲伤，但就此而言
Looking at it from our current viewpoint, it looks rather primitive and sad but at that

22
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:54,960
时间，我认为这是一个重大突破。
time, I think it was a significant breakthrough.

23
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,939
人工智能一词可能最初是在本研究提案中引入的
The term artificial intelligence was probably first introduced in this research proposal

24
00:01:59,939 --> 00:02:06,409
从1955年开始，一群非常迫近的人，其中包括JohnMcCarthy和MarvinMinsky，
from 1955 by a bunch of very imminent people, amongst them John McCarthy and Marvin Minsky,

25
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:11,430
他们是人工智能社区中非常知名的人物。
who are very very well known names in the artificial intelligence community.

26
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:16,870
到1955年，数字计算机已成为现实，这群科学家对此感兴趣
By 1955, digital computers had become a reality and this group of scientists were interested

27
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:22,599
试图探索除了简单的数值计算之外他们能做些什么。所以
in trying to explore what could they do beyond straightforward numerical calculation. So

28
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:27,069
他们对神经网络，计算理论等问题感兴趣
they were interested in things like neural networks, theories of computation, could we

29
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:33,660
使用计算机进行自然语言处理，他们可以进行创造性的行为吗？
use computers to do natural language processing, could they perform acts of creativity?

30
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,380
通过查看他们建议调查的主题列表，您会注意到什么
What you'll notice from looking at the list of topics that they proposed to investigate

31
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:43,190
在他们的夏季项目中，没有提到机器人，也没有提到计算机
in their summer project was there's no mention of robotics and there is no mention of computer

32
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:48,520
视力。原因是这两件事尚未发明。
vision. The reason for that is that those two things had not yet been invented.

33
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:53,020
我们今天所知的第一台工业机器人是由UnimationInc.开发的。
The first industrial robot as we know it today was developed by Unimation Inc.

34
00:02:53,020 --> 00:02:56,380
直到1956年，该公司才成立，
and that company wasn't even formed until 1956,

35
00:02:56,380 --> 00:03:03,280
人工智能项目和Unimation在1961年交付了第一台机器人一年后。
one year after the artificial intelligence project and Unimation delivered its first robot in 1961.

36
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,280
但此后，其他一些机器人出现了相当快速的连续性。
But thereafter, a number other robots appeared in quite rapid succession.

37
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:12,160
它们都是在斯坦福大学的人工智能实验室开发的
They were all developed within artificial intelligence laboratories at Stanford and

38
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:18,239
麻省理工学院和这些机器人设计师中的主要成员是设计ORM的VictorScheinman
at MIT and chief amongst these robot designers was Victor Scheinman who designed the ORM

39
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:25,819
和ORM我相信，蛇是挪威人，他还在1968年设计了着名的斯坦福大学。
and ORM I believe, is Norwegian for snake and he also designed the very famous Stanford arm in 1968.

40
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:33,160
1964年，计算机视觉开始于麻省理工学院LarryRoberts的博士学位。
Computer vision really got its start in 1964 with the PhD work of Larry Roberts at MIT.

41
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:38,610
他有兴趣了解计算机如何解释块世界。所以一台相机
He was interested in understanding how computers could interpret a blocks world. So a camera

42
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,660
连接到计算机将采用场景的灰度图像和各种各样的
attached to a computer would take a gray-scale image of a scene and with various sorts of

43
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:49,110
早期的图像处理算法，可以找到边缘，然后拟合模型。拉里
early image processing algorithms, could find the edges and then fit a model to that. Larry

44
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:53,450
罗伯茨继续在创建互联网方面做了很多伟大的事情。
Roberts went on to do really great things in the creation of the Internet.

45
00:03:53,450 --> 00:03:58,550
那么，什么是情报？我可以查看字典并获得定义
So then, what is intelligence? I can look in the dictionary and get a definition of

46
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:04,180
情报，但对我来说，这不是特别有帮助。我想我们假设是人类
intelligence, but to me, this is not particularly helpful. I think we assume that human beings

47
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:09,920
因此，人类表现出来的行为就像智慧一样。
are intelligent so therefore, the behaviors manifest by human beings count as intelligence.

48
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:15,129
但是我们知道有很多动物可以表现出智能行为
But we know that there are many animals that can exhibit intelligent behavior and it's

49
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:19,859
在越来越多的简单动物中被发现。曾几何时，我们相信也许是这样
been found in more and more simple animals. Once upon a time, we believed it was perhaps

50
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,199
只有能够表现出某种智力的巨猿，但现在科学家才有
only the great apes that could exhibit some sort of intelligence but now scientists have

51
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:29,070
在各种物种中都发现了相当聪明的行为。即使是鸟类也能够流行
found quite intelligent behaviors in all manner of species. Even birds are able to fashion

52
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,240
简单的工具，帮助他们完成特定的任务。
simple tools to help them to achieve particular tasks.

53
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:37,040
我特别喜欢的定义来自罗德尼布鲁克斯，那就是情报
A definition I particularly like comes from Rodney Brooks and that is that intelligence

54
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,580
是在旁观者的眼中。所以，如果你正在看一台机器做一些任务而你
is in the eye of the beholder. So if you're looking at a machine doing some task and you

55
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:44,620
认为它是聪明的，那么它是聪明的。
think it's intelligent, then it is intelligent.

56
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:49,130
也许最着名的智能定义是图灵测试，它是由提出来的
Perhaps the best known definition of intelligence is the Turing test and it was proposed by

57
00:04:49,130 --> 00:04:55,410
英国数学家艾伦·图灵（AlanTuring）在1950年的一篇名为“计算机械与计算机械”的论文中
the English mathematician, Alan Turing, in a 1950 paper called Computing Machinery and

58
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:59,449
情报。在那篇特别的论文中，他提出了一种叫做模仿游戏的东西，
Intelligence. In that particular paper, he proposed something called the imitation game,

59
00:04:59,449 --> 00:05:05,180
当然，这是最近关于阿兰图灵生平的电影的名字。
and of course that's the name of the recent movie about the life of Alan Turing.

60
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:10,310
游戏中有三个玩家：A是正在接受智力测试的计算机，B
The game has three players: A is a computer which is being tested for intelligence, B

61
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:15,990
是一个真正的人，而C是法官。法官不知道A或B中的哪一个
is a real human being, and C is the judge. The judge doesn't know which of A or B is

62
00:05:15,990 --> 00:05:21,550
计算机，所以问A和B的问题，试图确定哪个是哪个。
the computer and so asks questions of A and B to try and determine which is which.

63
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:26,340
为了掩盖关于A或B中的哪一个是计算机，游戏的真正明显的线索
In order to mask the really obvious cues about which one of A or B is the computer, the game

64
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:32,000
通常使用键盘和屏幕通信进行播放，因此没有语言通信。
is generally played with keyboard and screen communication, so there's no verbal communications.

65
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:39,060
判断器在键盘上键入命令，A或B响应屏幕上显示的信息。
The judge types commands on a keyboard, A or B respond with information displayed on a screen.

66
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,820
现在，如果法官在提出足够的问题后，无法确定哪一项
Now if the judge, after asking sufficient questions, is unable to determine which of

67
00:05:43,820 --> 00:05:48,490
A或B是计算机，然后计算机被认为是智能的，因为法官，
A or B is the computer, then the computer is deemed to be intelligent because the judge,

68
00:05:48,490 --> 00:05:53,490
谁是聪明的，无法区分它和真正的人类。
who is intelligent, is unable to tell the difference between it and a real human being.
