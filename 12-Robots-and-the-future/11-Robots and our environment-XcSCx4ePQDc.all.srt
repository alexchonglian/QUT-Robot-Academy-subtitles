1
00:00:03,189 --> 00:00:08,259
我们作为一个物种拥有的最大资产是我们的星球，我们知道它的存在
The biggest asset that we have as a species is our planet and we know that it’s under

2
00:00:08,259 --> 00:00:13,490
一些压力。这个非常着名的图表显示了二氧化碳水平的变化
some stress. This very famous graph here shows the variation in carbon dioxide levels in

3
00:00:13,490 --> 00:00:19,010
大气作为时间的函数。而且我们可以看到有一个不可阻挡的向上
the atmosphere as a function of time. And we can see that there is an inexorable upward

4
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:24,730
趋势，这将对这个星球上的生活产生各种各样的影响。所以
trend and that’s going to have all sorts of consequences for life on this planet. So

5
00:00:24,730 --> 00:00:30,090
我们需要了解地球如何应对不断增长的所有不同压力
we need to understand how the planet is responding to all the different stresses that the growing

6
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:33,300
人口正在接受它。
human population is placing on it.

7
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,190
最近，我们非常擅长研究其他星球。这是一幅可爱的照片
During recent times, we become very good at studying other planets. This is a lovely picture

8
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:43,969
这显示了NASA向火星和这些探测器发送的许多漫游车
that shows a number of the rover vehicles that NASA has sent to Mars and these rovers

9
00:00:43,969 --> 00:00:48,929
关于那个星球上发生的事情已经取得了很好的发现。特别是他们
have made wonderful discoveries about what's happened on that planet. In particular, they’ve

10
00:00:48,929 --> 00:00:54,170
几乎证明了水曾经存在于这个星球上的事实。但是我们呢
pretty much proven the fact that water once existed on that planet. But what about our

11
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:58,690
自己的星球？嗯，在我们自己的星球上，我们有很多科学家，他们花了很多钱
own planet? Well, on our own planet we have lots of scientists who spend a lot of their

12
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:04,519
收集数据的时间，试图获得有关地球健康状况的最新信息。但是收集
time collecting data to try and get an update on the health of the planet. But collecting

13
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:10,080
这种数据非常非常耗费人力。以下是科学家收集的一些图片
this kind of data is very, very labour intensive. And here are some images of scientists collecting

14
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:13,140
水下标本。
specimens under water.

15
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,120
这种手动数据收集费用的一个问题是我们不能
One of the problems with the expense of this manual collection of data is that we can't

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:23,030
收集很多数据。收集标本或进行测量是不可能的
collect very much data. It’s not possible to collect specimens or make measurements

17
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:28,810
在这个星球的每个角落，我们也不能经常访问这些点。所以抽样
at every point on the planet and nor can we visit those points very often. So the sampling

18
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:33,480
我们做的，我们做的测量非常稀少。我们不会访问很多
that we do, the measurements that we make are very sparse. We do not visit very many

19
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:38,770
地方，我们不经常访问它们。底线是我们正在抽样
places and we do not visit them very often. The bottom line is that we are under sampling

20
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:44,070
这个星球让人很难理解一些潜在的生物
the planet and that makes it difficult to understand some of the underlying biological

21
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:47,500
和正在发生的生态过程。
and ecological processes that are occurring.

22
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:52,660
但如果不是人们收集数据呢？如果我们派出机器人来做那件事怎么办？
But what if it wasn't people collecting the data? What if we sent robots out to do that

23
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:59,280
代替？多年来，许多机器人专家为此目的建造了机器人，
instead? And over the years many roboticists have built robots for exactly this purpose,

24
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,340
用于环境数据收集。在这里，我们有一个可以制造的机器人飞行器
for environmental data collection. Here we have a robotic flying vehicle which can make

25
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:10,269
极端天气系统（如旋风或飓风）内的气象观测。
meteorological observations inside extreme weather systems like cyclones or hurricanes.

26
00:02:10,269 --> 00:02:14,870
这个机器人是由卡内基梅隆大学开发的，有腿和强奸
This robot here was develop by Carnegie Mellon University and has legs and the rapelling

27
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:20,330
电缆允许它下降到火山的火山口进行测量
cable which allows it to descend into the crater of a volcano to make measurements of

28
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:25,710
那里有液体和气体。已经开发出Blimps以实现自主环境
liquids and gases there. Blimps have been developed to make autonomous environmental

29
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:30,680
调查亚马逊流域的大面积雨林。
surveys of large areas of rainforest such as in the Amazon basin.

30
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:36,090
这个漂亮的太空外观水下车辆用于探索墨西哥的落水洞。该
This pretty spacey looking underwater vehicle is use to explore sinkholes in Mexico. The

31
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:41,660
Nomad流浪者也是由卡内基梅隆大学开发的，曾被用来表演南极洲
Nomad rover was also develop by Carnegie Mellon University and was used to perform Antarctic

32
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:46,900
调查，特别是寻找倒下的陨石。这里的机器人船是
survey, in particular searching for fallen meteorites. And the robotic boat here was

33
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:52,810
我的同事在CSIRO开发并进行了水质测量
develop by colleagues of mine at CSIRO and performed measurements of water quality over

34
00:02:52,810 --> 00:02:55,290
一个非常大的蓄水池的表面。
the surface of a very large water storage.

35
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:01,360
一个非常有趣的发展是Argo浮动。这张地图显示了一张快照
A really interesting development is the Argo float. And this map shows a snapshot of the

36
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:07,050
Argo漂浮在世界各地。这些花车真的是非常简单的机器人。他们向上移动
Argo floats around the world. These floats are really very simple robots. They move up

37
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:11,330
通过控制它们的浮力来降下水柱。随着他们上下移动
and down the water column by controlling their buoyancy. And as they move up and down in

38
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:17,040
水柱他们测量温度和盐度和其他物理参数。
the water column they measure temperature and salinity and other physical parameters.

39
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,830
它们漂浮在海洋的洋流中。所以他们允许我们从三个方面进行探索
They drift in the currents of the ocean. So they allow us to explore in three dimensions

40
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:27,190
在我们的海洋中发生了什么。如果您对有关浮子的更多信息感兴趣
what's going on in our oceans. If you're interested in more information about the floats have

41
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:29,020
看看这个URL在这里。[注意：替换视频中的URL]
a look at this URL here. [Note:Replace URL in Video]

42
00:03:29,020 --> 00:03:34,610
以下是我大学同事对这些人群感兴趣的一个例子
Here is an example from colleagues at my University who interested in the population of these

43
00:03:34,610 --> 00:03:38,950
温柔的生物叫儒艮。儒艮可以在世界各地找到，但有
gentle creatures called dugongs. Dugongs can be found all around the world but there's

44
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:45,099
他们在布里斯班市外的莫顿湾有大量人口。
a large population of them in Moreton Bay which is the port just outside my city of Brisbane.

45
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:49,190
他们使用带有向下看的摄像头的无人驾驶飞行器拍照
They used an unmanned aerial vehicle with downward looking cameras to take pictures

46
00:03:49,190 --> 00:03:54,569
从空中。然后是一些图像处理技术来检测和计算儒艮内的儒艮
from the air. And then some image processing techniques to detect and count dugongs within

47
00:03:54,569 --> 00:03:59,420
海湾。我们没有派潜水员去寻找和统计儒艮。我们可以飞
the bay. We don't have to send divers down to find and count the dugongs. We can fly

48
00:03:59,420 --> 00:04:04,129
在海湾上方，可以自动测量有多少儒艮和下落
over the bay to get automatic measurements of how many dugongs there are and whereabouts

49
00:04:04,129 --> 00:04:05,700
他们在海湾。
in the bay they are.

50
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,410
现在，进行这种调查的无人驾驶飞行器或飞行机器人已经得到了
Now, an unmanned aerial vehicle or flying robot that does this kind of survey has got

51
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,879
有限的耐力。它只能在空气中播放一段时间才能播出
a limited endurance. It can only be in the air for a certain amount of time before it

52
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,129
耗尽燃料。但是很多研究人员现在开始关注太阳能供电
runs out of fuel. But a lot of researchers are now starting to look at solar powered

53
00:04:19,129 --> 00:04:24,560
机器人。这是太阳能机器人的照片，在我的大学再次开发
robots. This is a picture of a solar powered robot, again developed at my University, which

54
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,600
可以永远留在空中。人们正在研究太阳能船和太阳能供电
can stay in the air forever. And people are looking at solar powered boats and solar powered

55
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,750
水下航行器和太阳能陆地机器人。所以这是一项技术
underwater vehicles and solar powered land robots as well. So this is a technology which

56
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:40,370
允许我们将智能机器放入可持久的环境中
allows us to put intelligent machines into the environment where they can persistently

57
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:46,130
监测行星状态并发回大量频繁测量的测量值
monitor the state of the planet and send back lots of measurements taken at frequent intervals

58
00:04:46,130 --> 00:04:49,379
并覆盖了我们星球表面的大片区域。
and covering a large expanse of our planet's surface.
