1
00:00:03,699 --> 00:00:09,760
彼得：机器人飞机正在变得无处不在。现在整个班级都非常复杂
Peter: Robotic aircraft are becoming ubiquitous. There's a whole class now of quite sophisticated

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,870
玩具你可以去商店购买几百美元。一般来说，有
toys you can go and buy from the shop for a few hundred bucks. Generally, there are

3
00:00:13,870 --> 00:00:18,000
四旋翼机。您可以使用iPhone控制它们。你可以飞起来。您
quad rotor machines. You can control them with your iPhone. You can fly them up. You

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,180
可以看出邻居的围栏。你可以看看邻居的窗口。所以，这项技术
can look out the neighbor's fence. You can look in neighbor's window. So, this technology

5
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:30,050
开始引起人们对隐私的严重关注。道格，什么呢
is starting to cause people serious concerns with respect to privacy. So Doug, what does

6
00:00:30,050 --> 00:00:32,270
关于隐私的道德说法？
ethics say about privacy?

7
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:39,100
道格：隐私的构建是一种现代的结构。
Doug: The construct of privacy is a modern construct.

8
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:42,360
彼得：好的。我们没有使用隐私？
Peter: Okay. We didn't use to have privacy?

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:45,300
道格：嗯，这是文化定义的。
Doug: Well, it's culturally defined.

10
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:55,340
道格：换句话说，我认为今天在21世纪的澳大利亚是私密的，你是什么
Doug: In other words, what I consider private today in 21st century Australia and what you

11
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:04,589
在1850年的伦敦会考虑私人，这是完全不同的。我们选择的是什么
would consider private in 1850 London, it's quite different. What we choose in terms of

12
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:09,979
隐私是不同的。它随时间和地点而变化。然而-
privacy is different. It's contextual over time and place. However--

13
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:12,710
彼得：那么，这不是一个基本的基本原则吗？
Peter: So, it's not a fundamental underlying principle?

14
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:13,310
道格：不。
Doug: No.

15
00:01:13,310 --> 00:01:13,909
彼得：好的。
Peter: Okay.

16
00:01:13,909 --> 00:01:19,299
道格：不，绝对不是。隐私不是。它建立在自由民主和国家
Doug: No, absolutely not. Privacy is not. It's founded in liberal democracy and the

17
00:01:19,299 --> 00:01:27,770
个人有权选择并拥有自己的空间。美国人是唯一的，
right of the individual to choose and have their own space. The Americans are the only,

18
00:01:27,770 --> 00:01:32,679
我认为他们是唯一拥有财产权的文化。拥有财产权
I think they're the only culture that has right to property. With the right to property

19
00:01:32,679 --> 00:01:36,639
来隐私权。但是，隐私程度当然是正确的
comes right to privacy. But the degree of privacy, of course, is being argued right

20
00:01:36,639 --> 00:01:39,759
现在在澳大利亚获取数据。
now in Australia in terms of access to data.

21
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:40,700
彼得：当然。
Peter: Absolutely.

22
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:46,039
道格：是的。因此，在道德方面，它又回到了那些基本职责或者
Doug: Yes. So, in terms of ethics, it goes back again to those fundamental duties or

23
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:52,270
那些自治的基本概念。因此，我们在自治方面拥有自由度。
those fundamental concepts of autonomy. So, we have levels of freedom in terms of autonomy.

24
00:01:52,270 --> 00:02:00,229
所以，这些级别从自由，当然，从克制到选择的自由，
So, those levels go from freedom, of course, of restraint down to the freedom of choice,

25
00:02:00,229 --> 00:02:07,179
然后通知原因，知情选择，最后，基于认可的选择
then to informed reason, informed choice and lastly, the choice based on the recognition

26
00:02:07,179 --> 00:02:14,220
道德价值观。因此，这些是在道德方面至关重要的自治方面。现在，
of moral values. So, those are areas in terms of autonomy that are critical in ethics. Now,

27
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:25,750
如果你失去了隐私，就道德而言，这里唯一的道德论点是它如何影响
if you lose your privacy, in terms of ethics, the only ethical argument here is how it affects

28
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:32,650
你的个人自主权来做出决定。但隐私当然不是道德问题，
your individual autonomy to make decisions. But privacy is certainly not an ethical issue,

29
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:33,780
这是一个文化问题。
it's a cultural issue.

30
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,420
彼得：所以，如果它压缩你的风格或改变你能做的事情，那么这是一个道德问题。
Peter: So, if it's cramping your style or it's changing what you can do, then it's an ethical issue.

31
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,120
道格：是的。
Doug: It is.

32
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,799
道格：因为它影响了你的选择权。同样，这是一个现代的结构
Doug: Because it's affecting your power of choice. Again, that's a modern construct is

33
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:51,150
隐私。这是一个现代建筑。这是完全不同的。例如，在罗马时代你
privacy. It's a modern construct. It's quite different. For example, in Roman times you

34
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:55,150
今天可能会和其他人一起洗澡-或者你不洗澡-和其他人一起洗澡
may take a shower - or you don't take a shower you take baths - with other people, today

35
00:02:55,150 --> 00:03:00,360
我们有自己的浴室。但隐私......当我和五个孩子和两个卧室一起长大...
we have our own bathrooms. But privacy… when I grew up with five kids and two bedrooms…

36
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,000
现在它是一个不同的结构，对吧？
it's a different construct now, right?

37
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,349
彼得：是的。
Peter: Yes.

38
00:03:04,349 --> 00:03:05,969
道格：这是文化决定的。
Doug: It's culturally determined.

39
00:03:05,969 --> 00:03:10,409
彼得：有些人说隐私是一个概念
Peter: There are some people who say that privacy is a concept that is just going to

40
00:03:10,409 --> 00:03:12,409
走开，我们应该习惯它。
go away and we should just get used to it.

41
00:03:12,409 --> 00:03:13,099
道格：是的。
Doug: Yes.

42
00:03:13,099 --> 00:03:17,489
彼得：特别是关于我们的在线存在和身份。
Peter: Particularly, with respect to our online existence and identities.

43
00:03:17,489 --> 00:03:22,509
道格：是的，是的。自治是问题，而不是隐私。
Doug: Yes, yes. Autonomy is the issue, not privacy.
