1
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:08,670
让我们来看看食物的更多细节，这是人类生活的基本要求。
Let’s look in a bit more detail at food, a fundamental requirement for human life.

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:14,320
联合国预测，到2050年，我们将需要增加70％的粮食
The United Nations predicts that by the year 2050, we will need a 70% increase in food

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:21,240
生产。并非所有这一切都是由于人口增加。很多是由于要求
production. Not all of this is due to increase population. A lot of it is due to the requirements

4
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:25,039
我们星球上的许多人拥有的食物比他们目前所拥有的更多
of many of the people on our planet to have more food than they’re currently getting

5
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,869
也许更高质量的食物，更高热值的食物。所以，增加的一个很大的要求
and perhaps higher quality food, higher calorific value food. So, a big requirement to increase

6
00:00:30,869 --> 00:00:37,710
食品生产和70％是在30年内实现的大幅增长。
food production and 70% is a massive increase to be achieved in something like 30 years.

7
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,739
很明显，我们需要食物供人们食用。我们还需要动物食物
It’s pretty obvious that we need food for people to eat. We also need food for animals

8
00:00:42,739 --> 00:00:47,210
去吃。它们是我们食物链的一部分。所以，我们生产的很多食物都被吃掉了
to eat. They are part of our food chain. So, a lot of the food that we produce is eaten

9
00:00:47,210 --> 00:00:50,800
通过动物，反过来，我们许多人吃这些动物。
by animals and in turn, many of us eat those animals.

10
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:55,910
对食物来说有点令人惊讶的用途就是把它放在汽车里。有一个很大的运动
A somewhat surprising use for food is putting it in cars. There’s quite a movement to

11
00:00:55,910 --> 00:01:01,719
将食品，尤其是玉米转化为乙醇，我们将乙醇加入气体中
turn food product, particularly corn into ethanol and we put the ethanol into the gas

12
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:06,550
我们汽车的坦克。因此，我们生产的食品竞争很激烈。
tanks of our cars. So, there’s a lot of competition for the food that we produce.

13
00:01:06,550 --> 00:01:10,390
当然，我们想要人们吃的食物，但也需要食物
Absolutely, we want food for people to eat but there’s also food that’s required

14
00:01:10,390 --> 00:01:14,299
喂养动物，还有喂养汽车所需的食物。
to feed animals and there’s also food that’s required to feed cars.

15
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:18,860
随着人口的增长，我们城市的规模也在增长。城市变大了;他们
As our population grows, so too does the size of our cities. The cities get larger; they

16
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:23,960
侵占生产性农田。他们把这块土地从粮食生产中拿走了，因为我们
encroach on productive farmland. They take that land out of food production because we

17
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:29,130
在它上面建造房屋和公寓，这意味着我们可以减少种植粮食的土地。
build houses and apartments on it, so that means we have less land on which to grow food.

18
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:33,470
现在，这是一个问题，因为总的来说我们需要种植更多的食物而我们正在消除
Now, this is a problem because overall we need to grow more food and we’re removing

19
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:37,810
土地是粮食生产的必需资源。
land which is the essential resource when it comes to food production.

20
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:43,100
另一个问题是农民作为一个人口正在变老。这个统计数据来自
Another issue is that farmers as a population are getting older. This statistic is from

21
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:47,719
我的国家，澳大利亚，我们在这里查看这个直方图，它显示了平均值
my country, Australia, and we look at this histogram here and it shows that the average

22
00:01:47,719 --> 00:01:53,740
农民的年龄远远超过50岁。没有年轻人从事农业作为一种职业
age of farmers is well above 50. There's not young people moving into farming as a profession

23
00:01:53,740 --> 00:01:58,860
或作为一种生活方式。我国澳大利亚的一个非常可怕的统计数据是下一个
or as a lifestyle. A very scary statistic in my country, Australia, is that in the next

24
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:04,340
十年来，有一半的农民将要退休。那么，谁将在陆地上做这项工作
decade, half of the farmers are going to retire. So, who’s going to do the work on the land

25
00:02:04,340 --> 00:02:06,310
生产我们需要的食物？
to produce the food that we need?

26
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:11,670
因此，机器人技术的一个机会是帮助和解决这种食品生产
So, one of the opportunities for robotics is to help and solve this food production

27
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:17,990
问题。一种应用是转换这些用于工业的大型机器
problem. One application is to convert these large machines which are used in industrial

28
00:02:17,990 --> 00:02:22,830
规模粮食生产。而不是驾驶它的机器上有人，
scale food production. Instead of having a human being on board the machine driving it,

29
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:29,580
我们把它变成一个机器人车辆，这样它可以一周7天，每天24小时独自驾驶。
we turn it into a robotic vehicle so it can drive all by itself, 24 hours a day, seven days a week.

30
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:34,500
我们可以做的另一件事是更换用于喷洒农作物的人力驱动机器
Another thing we can do is to replace human-driven machines which are used to spray crops in

31
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:41,800
田地和我们喷洒农作物，以消除昆虫和杂草害虫。而不是做不分青红皂白
the field and we spray the crops to eliminate insect and weed pests. Rather than doing indiscriminate

32
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:46,390
如你所见，喷涂我们可以拥有更智能的机器人系统
spraying as you see here, we can have much more intelligent, robotic systems which move

33
00:02:46,390 --> 00:02:51,270
或许通过作物更慢，并使用识别昆虫害虫的视觉传感器
perhaps more slowly through the crop and use vision sensors which identify insects pests

34
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:56,670
或者我们称之为杂草的不良植物，并将适当的化学物质施用于其中
or undesirable plants which we call weeds and apply the appropriate chemical to just

35
00:02:56,670 --> 00:03:02,050
这种情况不是随处可见，而不是无处不在。这是一个巨大的环境
where that occurrence is, not indiscriminately, not everywhere. That’s got huge environmental

36
00:03:02,050 --> 00:03:07,150
由于我们可以减少化学品的数量，因此它也带来了巨大的成本效益
benefits and it’s also got huge cost benefits because we can reduce the amount of chemical

37
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:09,390
需要应用。
that needs to be applied.

38
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:15,040
使用化学除草剂来控制杂草导致了意想不到的结果
The use of chemical herbicides to control weeds has led to an unexpected outcome and

39
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:20,810
也就是说，许多杂草物种现在已经进化出对这些标准除草剂的抗性。
that is that many weed species have now evolved a resistance to these standard herbicides.

40
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:24,940
这对已经发展起来的农业系统提出了特殊的挑战
That presents a particular challenge to an agricultural system which has developed over

41
00:03:24,940 --> 00:03:31,040
几十年，并且非常依赖于使用除草剂来控制杂草。所以，也许吧
decades and become incredibly reliant on the use of herbicides for weed control. So, perhaps

42
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,970
智能机器人可以识别土壤中的杂草并将其机械破坏，如图所示，
smart robots could identify weeds in the soil and destroy them mechanically as shown here,

43
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,620
实际上是打扰了杂草周围的土壤来破坏杂草。
actually disturb the soil around the weed to destroy the weed.

44
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:45,630
这是我们在QUT的实验室研究项目中开发的机器人视频。
Here’s a video of a robot we’ve developed in a research project in my lab here at QUT.

45
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:51,270
这是我们的杂草喷涂机器人的早期原型。这是一台非常小的机器。它的
This is an early prototype of our weed spraying robot. It’s a very small machine. It’s

46
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:56,720
由相机和其他类型的传感器引导。它可以沿着裁剪行导航并应用
guided by cameras and other sorts of sensors. It can navigate along crop rows and apply

47
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,000
除草剂只在需要的地方。
herbicide only where it’s required.
