00:00:03,389 --> 00:00:07,660
在接下来的几节中，我想谈谈所有面临的一些重大挑战
In the next few sections, I want to talk about some of the big challenges that confront all

2
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:13,699
我们作为一个社会，作为一个民族。我们面临的挑战的根本原因是
of us as a society, as a people. The root cause of the challenges that confront us are

3
00:00:13,699 --> 00:00:19,320
基本上是世界人口的增长。在此图中，此处显示了三种不同的方案。
essentially the world population growth. In this graph here shows, three different scenarios.

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,490
这些被称为中等增长模型，其行星的人口数量最多
These are called medium growth model, which has population of the planet topping out at

5
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:29,409
到2050年将达到89亿。低增长模式，即人口增长
8.9 billion by the 2050. The low growth model, which sees population

6
00:00:29,409 --> 00:00:35,490
实际上在大约2035年开始下降和相当可怕的高增长
actually starting to decline after about the year 2035 and the rather scary high growth

7
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:41,190
到2050年，这个地球上有106亿人口的模型。这将是必要的
model which sees 10.6 billion people in the planet by the year 2050. It's going to take

8
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:45,420
几年前，我们可以找出我们所处的特定线路。
a few years before we can work out which of these particular lines we are on.

9
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:49,530
这个星球上更多人的后果很多。首先，我们需要
The consequences of more people on the planet are many. For a start, we are going to need

10
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,600
再来点吃的。这个星球上还有更多的嘴巴要喂。
more food. There are more mouths to be fed on the planet.

11
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:58,289
我们需要更多资源。每个人都需要能源等资源
We are going to need more resources. Each person requires resources such as energy to

12
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:04,600
制造他们需要的物品，无论是住房还是其他种类的商品。我们需要材料
manufacture items that they need whether that's housing or other sorts of goods. We need materials

13
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:11,100
像金属和石油资源，我们需要水-饮用水和水
like metals and petroleum resources and we need water - water for drinking and also water

14
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,420
用于洗涤和制造用水，这些人需要的所有物品。
for washing and water for manufacturing, all the items that these people require.

15
00:01:16,420 --> 00:01:20,610
最后，还需要更多的交通工具。我们有更多的人
And finally, there is going to need a whole lot more transportation. We have more people

16
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:25,360
在这个星球上，更多人需要从A点到B点。所有这些资源
in the planet, more people will need to go from point A to point B. All these resources

17
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,880
需要从生产地运输到将要使用的地方。
need to be transported from where they are produced to where they are going to be used.

18
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:35,049
因此，增加了人员的运输量和人们所需的资源。
So, increased amount of transportation for people and the resources that the people require.
