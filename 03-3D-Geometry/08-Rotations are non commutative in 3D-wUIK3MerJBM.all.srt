00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:09,040
现在我们将讨论3D中旋转的一个更令人困惑的元素。
Now we're going to talk about one of the more perplexing elements of rotations in 3D.

2
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:12,710
我这里有三个坐标框架，它们最初都是相互平行的。
I've got three coordinate frames here and they're all initially parallel to each other.

3
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:15,669
x轴，y轴和z轴都是对齐的。
The x-axes, the y-axes and the z-axes are all aligned.

4
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:20,800
我要拿起第一个，红色的那个，我要将它旋转+90度
I'm going to pick up the first one, the red one, and I'm going to rotate it by +90 degrees

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,500
围绕它的x轴。
around its x-axis.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:26,810
正向是这个方向，所以在x轴上旋转90度后，它看起来像
Positive is in this direction so after rotating it by 90 degrees in x-axis, it looks like

7
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:27,810
这个。
this.

8
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:31,150
而现在我要围绕y轴旋转+90度。
And now I'm going to rotate it by +90 degrees around the y-axis.

9
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:33,910
所以这个框架最终看起来像这样。
So this frame is going to end up looking like this.

10
00:00:33,910 --> 00:00:35,470
这是它的最终定位。
This is its final orientation.

11
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:37,860
我只想把它放在那里。
I'm just going to put it down there.

12
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,579
我打算拿起蓝框，我将在相反的位置进行旋转
I'm going to pick up the blue frame and I'm going to do the rotation within the opposite

13
00:00:42,579 --> 00:00:43,710
订购。
order.

14
00:00:43,710 --> 00:00:48,070
首先，我要围绕y轴旋转+90度。
First of all, I'm going to rotate it by +90 degrees around the y-axis.

15
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:49,250
这是积极的方向。
That's the positive direction.

16
00:00:49,250 --> 00:00:51,530
所以它最初看起来像这样。
So it's initially going to look like this.

17
00:00:51,530 --> 00:00:55,350
现在我要围绕x轴旋转+90度。
And now I'm going to rotate it by +90 degrees around the x-axis.

18
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:59,430
x轴现在指向下方，这是正旋转方向。
The x-axis is now pointing downwards, that's the positive rotation direction.

19
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,120
所以这就是最终定位的样子。
So this is what the final orientation will look like.

20
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,840
我们可以看到这两个框架的方向非常不同。
And we can see that these two frames have gotten very, very different orientations.

21
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:12,000
因此，当涉及到三维旋转时，您执行它们的顺序
So when it comes to doing rotations in three dimensions, the order in which you do them

22
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,430
至关重要。
is critically important.

23
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:16,330
轮换不是可交换的。
Rotations are not to commutative.

24
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:21,490
让我们看一下旋转矩阵乘法的非交换性质。
Let's look at the non-commutative nature of rotation matrix multiplication.

25
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:26,340
我将围绕x轴旋转90度。
I'm going to have a rotation of 90 degrees around the x-axis.

26
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:31,390
然后我将围绕y轴旋转90度。
And then I'm going to rotate by 90 degrees around the y-axis.

27
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:34,610
结果旋转矩阵看起来像这样。
And the resulting rotation matrix looks like this.

28
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:40,430
如果我以相反的顺序执行此操作，我将首先围绕y轴旋转，然后我将旋转
If I do this in the opposite order, I'll rotate around the y-axis first, and then I'll rotate

29
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:43,880
在x轴周围，每种情况下都是90度。
around the x-axis, by 90 degrees in each case.

30
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,540
我最终得到了一个看起来像这样的旋转矩阵。
I end up with a resulting rotation matrix which looks like this.

31
00:01:47,540 --> 00:01:52,200
我们可以看到这两个矩阵是完全不同的。
And we can see that these two matrices are quite different.

32
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:55,770
当您将旋转矩阵相乘时，顺序非常重要。
When you're multiplying rotation matrices, the order is critically important.
