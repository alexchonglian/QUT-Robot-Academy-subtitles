1
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:08,320
考虑这两个坐标框架，框架A和框架B.它们都是右撇子
Consider these two coordinate frames, frame A and frame B. They are both right-handed

2
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:09,920
坐标框架。
coordinate frames.

3
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,589
我们试图解决的问题是如何描述框架B的旋转
And the problem we’re trying to solve is how do we describe the rotation of frame B

4
00:00:13,589 --> 00:00:19,200
关于框架A.想象一下，我们可以拿起框架A并在空间中旋转它
with respect to frame A. Imagine we could pick up frame A and rotate it in space so

5
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:23,870
它的轴与框架B的轴平行。我们怎么做？
that its axes were parallel to those of frame B. How do we do that?

6
00:00:23,870 --> 00:00:29,560
好吧，一位非常着名的瑞士数学家LeonhardEuler提出了所谓的旋转
Well, a very famous Swiss mathematician, Leonhard Euler, came up with what’s called the Rotation

7
00:00:29,560 --> 00:00:30,560
定理。
Theorem.

8
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:36,280
它指出两个三维坐标系由一系列基本相关
It states that two three-dimensional coordinate frames are related by a sequence of elementary

9
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,550
旋转，例如关于x轴，y轴，z轴的旋转。
rotations such as those about the x-axis, the y-axis, the z-axis.

10
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:45,460
我们需要应用不超过三个，但这个顺序的旋转需要
We need to apply no more than three of those, but the rotations in this sequence need to

11
00:00:45,460 --> 00:00:50,719
关于不同的轴;那就是我们围绕x轴旋转，然后旋转y轴，然后旋转
be about different axes; that is we’d rotate about x-axis, then the y-axis, then maybe

12
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,260
x轴再次或可能绕z轴。
the x-axis again or maybe about the z-axis.

13
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:59,370
因此，任何旋转都可以表示为不超过三次旋转
So any rotation can be expressed in terms of no more than three rotations as long as

14
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:04,780
这三个旋转连续地围绕不同的轴。
those three rotations are consecutively about different axes.

15
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:07,530
让我们来演示这个旋转定理。
Let’s demonstrate this Rotation Theorem.

16
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:12,460
在这里，我有我的世界参考框架，在这里我有一个坐标框架
Here, I have my world reference frame and here I have a coordinate frame that has got

17
00:01:12,460 --> 00:01:14,310
空间中的任意方向。
an arbitrary orientation in space.

18
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:19,270
因此，旋转定理说我应该能够采用这个坐标框架
And so, the Rotation Theorem says that I should be able to take this coordinate frame and

19
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:23,640
只需三次基本旋转即可实现这样的定位。
with simply three elementary rotations achieve an orientation like this.

20
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:27,039
所以，我将采用该世界参考框架的副本。
So, I’m going to take a copy of that world reference frame.

21
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:30,290
而且，我要做的第一件事是围绕x轴旋转一点。
And, first thing I’m going to do is to rotate it a little bit around the x-axis.

22
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:34,350
然后，我将围绕y轴旋转一点，然后我要去
Then, I’m going to rotate it a little bit around the y-axis, and then I’m going to

23
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,549
绕z轴旋转一下。
rotate it a bit around the z-axis.

24
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:40,770
如果我选择这个轴并把它放在这里，我们会看到它现在有一个大致的
And if I pick this axis up and put it in here, we’ll see that it now has a roughly the

25
00:01:40,770 --> 00:01:44,200
与我开始使用的蓝框相同的方向。
same orientation as the blue frame that I started with.

26
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:51,039
所以，让我们写下所有可能的旋转序列，我们应用这个警告
So, let’s write down all the possible sequences of rotation, where we apply this caveat that

27
00:01:51,039 --> 00:01:55,340
没有两个连续的旋转是围绕同一轴。
no two successive rotations are about the same axis.

28
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,700
事实上，有两个，我把它们写在这里。
In fact, there are two of them and I’ve written them all down here.

29
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:03,590
这些旋转分为两组，这里显示的组称为欧拉
These rotations fall into two groups and the group shown here are referred to as Euler

30
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:04,590
角。
angles.

31
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:08,869
并且，它们是围绕同一轴旋转两次的那些。
And, they are the ones where there are two rotations about the same axis.

32
00:02:08,869 --> 00:02:12,530
第一个是绕X旋转，然后旋转Y，然后再旋转X.
The first one is rotation about X, then Y, then X again.

33
00:02:12,530 --> 00:02:16,890
好吧，这一个是Y，然后是Z，然后是Y.
Well, this one over here is Y, then Z, then Y again.

34
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:24,030
因此，在欧拉角度组中，特定轴将出现两次，但不会连续出现两次。
So, in the Euler angle group, a particular axis will appear twice, but not twice consecutively.

35
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:29,250
这个特殊的群体;围绕Z旋转，然后围绕Y，然后围绕Z是相当的
This particular group; rotation around Z, then around Y, and then around Z is quite

36
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:34,250
通常称为欧拉角，但实际上有六个欧拉角。
commonly called Euler angles, but in fact there are six Euler angles.

37
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,470
因此，当我们谈论角度序列时，我们需要非常非常小心。
So, we need to be very, very careful when we talk about an angle sequence.

38
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:41,010
事实上，仅仅说欧拉角就不够好了。
It’s in fact not good enough just to say Euler angles.

39
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:46,299
我们应该非常具体并说出ZYZEuler角度。
We should be very specific and say ZYZ Euler angles.

40
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:51,040
不同的工程社区使用不同的约定，ZYZ惯例很漂亮
Different engineering communities use different conventions, and the ZYZ convention is pretty

41
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:55,269
常见于机器人和航空航天领域，但还有其他工程学科
common in robotics and in aerospace, but there are other engineering disciplines where they

42
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:57,110
使用不同的约定。
use different conventions.

43
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,810
当你谈到欧拉角时要非常非常小心。
Be very, very careful when you just talk about Euler angles.

44
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:05,870
让我们进行实验，在这里我们讨论的是ZYZ序列欧拉角。
Let’s experiment and here we’re talking about ZYZ sequence Euler angles.

45
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:13,989
我将使用工具箱函数eul2r，它采用三个角度参数，三个
I’m going to use the Toolbox function eul2r, which takes three angular arguments, the three

46
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:14,989
欧拉角。
Euler angles.

47
00:03:14,989 --> 00:03:17,459
而且，我只是给它们简单的值：0.1,0。
And, I’m just going to give them simple values: 0.1, 0.

48
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:20,430
分别为2和0.3弧度。
2 and 0.3 radians respectively.

49
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:25,780
并且，这是产生的旋转矩阵，其对应于三个欧拉角。
And, here is the resulting rotation matrix that corresponds to the three Euler angles.

50
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:31,590
因此，您可以将此视为坐标方向的两种替代表示
So you can think of this as two alternative representations for orientation of the coordinate

51
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:32,590
帧。
frame.

52
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,549
我们可以将它表示为3乘3正交矩阵，或者我们可以用三个数字表示它
We can represent it as a 3 by 3 orthogonal matrix or we can represent it by three numbers

53
00:03:37,549 --> 00:03:40,129
这是欧拉角。
which are the Euler angles.

54
00:03:40,129 --> 00:03:41,909
我可以执行逆操作。
I can perform the inverse operation.

55
00:03:41,909 --> 00:03:45,180
我可以将旋转矩阵转换为欧拉角。
I can convert a rotation matrix to Euler angles.

56
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:53,930
为此，我使用函数tr2eul，然后传入我们的旋转矩阵
To do that, I use the function tr2eul and I pass in the rotation matrix which we’ve

57
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,010
刚刚计算出来
just computed.

58
00:03:55,010 --> 00:03:57,790
在这里我们有欧拉角。
And here we have the Euler angles.

59
00:03:57,790 --> 00:04:02,959
所以我可以将欧拉角转换为旋转矩阵，将旋转矩阵转换回欧拉角。
So I can convert Euler angles to a rotation matrix, a rotation matrix back to Euler angles.

60
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:08,790
让我们来看一个稍微不同的情况，其中中欧拉角是负的
Let’s have a look at a slightly different case where the middle Euler angle is a negative

61
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,590
数字和结果是旋转矩阵。
number and the result is rotation matrix.

62
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:15,550
它与我们以前的旋转矩阵不同，因为它是不同的
It’s a different rotation matrix to the one we had before because it’s a different

63
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:16,750
欧拉角集。
set of Euler angles.

64
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:21,160
现在我将这个旋转矩阵转换回欧拉角。
Now I’ll convert this rotation matrix back to Euler angles.

65
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,389
我们将看到我们最终得到的欧拉角不是欧拉角
And we’ll see that the Euler angles that we end up with are not the Euler angles that

66
00:04:26,389 --> 00:04:27,840
我们一开始。
we started with.

67
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,830
因此，当我们考虑表示方向时，这是另一个重要的考虑因素
So this is another important consideration when we look at representing orientation in

68
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:38,940
这三个角度序列的术语：它们不是唯一的，但它们是两个不同的
terms of these three-angle sequences: that they are not unique, but they are two different

69
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:43,870
欧拉角的集合导致完全相同的旋转矩阵。
sets of Euler angles which result in exactly the same rotation matrix.

70
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:48,470
只是为了验证是这种情况，我将转换这个不同的集合
And just to verify that that is the case, I’m going to convert this different set

71
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,840
欧拉角与旋转矩阵的关系。
of Euler angles to a rotation matrix.

72
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:57,520
我将通过该答案，我们可以看到生成的旋转矩阵。
I’m going to pass that answer in and we can see the resulting rotation matrix.

73
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,620
我们可以看到它与这里的完全相同。
And we can see that it is exactly the same as this one here.

74
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,780
所以有两组欧拉角，它们的方向完全相同
So there are two sets of Euler angles which result in exactly the same orientation in

75
00:05:06,780 --> 00:05:12,240
空间，相同的旋转矩阵。
space, the same rotation matrix.

76
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:16,700
另一组旋转序列通常称为万向角。
The other group of rotation sequences are commonly called Cardan angles.

77
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:21,840
这些都是以一位着名的，或臭名昭着的意大利人的名字命名的，他是一名医生，一名占星师
These are named after a very famous, or infamous, Italian character who was a doctor, an astrologer

78
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,350
和一个赌徒，并在监狱中度过了一段异端邪说。
and a gambler and spent some time in jail for heresy.

79
00:05:25,350 --> 00:05:30,610
但他是一个非常非常有创造力的人，他发明了组合锁并发明了通用
But a very, very inventive person, he invented the combination lock and he invented the universal

80
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:35,160
关节，将扭矩从汽车前部的发动机传递到车轮
joint, the thing that transmits torque from an engine in the front of the car to the wheels

81
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,770
在车的后面。
at the back of the car.

82
00:05:36,770 --> 00:05:41,600
他还广泛发表概率论，是最早解决立方数的人之一
He also published widely on probability and was one of the first people to solve cubic

83
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,289
和四次多项式方程。
and quartic polynomial equations.

84
00:05:43,289 --> 00:05:45,789
所以一个非常非常聪明的人。
So a very, very bright person.

85
00:05:45,789 --> 00:05:50,199
万向角涉及围绕不同轴的旋转。
The Cardan angles involve rotations around different axes.

86
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:54,440
所以在旋转序列中没有重复的字母。
So no letter is repeated in the rotation sequence.

87
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:58,680
它们中的两个通常被称为滚动角，俯仰角和偏航角。
The two of them are often referred to as roll, pitch and yaw angles.

88
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,680
这是序列XYZ或序列ZYX。
That’s the sequence XYZ or the sequence ZYX.

89
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,479
哪个特定的用作滚动，俯仰，偏航角度取决于上下文
And which particular one is used as roll, pitch, yaw angles depends a bit on the context

90
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:09,479
这个问题。
of the problem.

91
00:06:09,479 --> 00:06:16,319
滚动，俯仰，偏航角度是三维物体定向的常见惯例
Roll, pitch, yaw angles are a really common convention for orientation of bodies in three-dimensional

92
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,319
空间。
space.

93
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:22,520
我们使x轴指向前方，因此滚动角度围绕x轴旋转。
We have the x-axis pointing forward and so the roll angle is rotation around the x-axis.

94
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,960
这是我们做的第一次轮换。
So that’s the first rotation that we do.

95
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,380
现在我们围绕y轴执行旋转，这称为俯仰。
Now we perform a rotation around the y-axis and that’s referred to as pitch.

96
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,069
这就是这种动作。
So that’s this sort of motion.

97
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:36,069
然后在旋转之后，我们围绕z轴进行旋转，我们将其称为
And then after that rotation, we do a rotation around the z-axis and we refer to that as

98
00:06:36,069 --> 00:06:37,069
偏航运动。
yaw motion.

99
00:06:37,069 --> 00:06:42,470
因此，滚动，俯仰，偏航对姿态的描述是围绕x轴旋转，然后是围绕
So roll, pitch, yaw description of attitude is a rotation around the x-axis, then around

100
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:45,700
y轴，然后绕z轴。
the y-axis, and then around the z-axis.

101
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:50,319
证明这种连续三次旋转原理的方法是用这种机制，
A way to demonstrate this principle of three consecutive rotations is with this mechanism,

102
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:52,550
一种称为万向节机制的东西。
a thing called a Gimbal mechanism.

103
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,410
所以，这里有两个坐标框架。
So, there are two coordinate frames here.

104
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:57,720
我们这里有世界参考坐标系，大红框。
We have the world reference coordinate frame here, the big red frame.

105
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,620
而且，我们这里的中间有一个较小的坐标系。
And, we have a smaller coordinate frame in the middle here.

106
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:07,520
现在，我们可以围绕x轴旋转，这是一个这样的运动。
Now, we can make a rotation around the x-axis, which is a motion like this.

107
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:11,600
我们可以围绕y轴旋转，这是一个像这样的旋转。
We can rotate around the y-axis, which is a rotation like this.

108
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,110
而且，我们可以围绕z轴旋转。
And, we can rotate around the z-axis.

109
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:19,860
所以，我可以将这个内部坐标框架放在我喜欢的任何方向和万向节上
So, I can put this inner coordinate frame at any orientation that I like and the gimbals

110
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:23,330
会找到合适的角度来实现这一点。
will find the appropriate angles to allow that to happen.

111
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:28,849
因此，这非常清楚地表明可以实现该内框架的任何方向
So this demonstrates very clearly shows that any orientation of this inner frame can be achieved

112
00:07:28,849 --> 00:07:35,160
通过围绕x，y和z轴任意选择三个旋转角度。
by arbitrary choice of three rotation angles around the x, y, and z-axis.

113
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,449
让我们来看看实际中的一些滚动，俯仰，偏航角度。
Let’s have a look at some roll, pitch, yaw angles in practice.

114
00:07:39,449 --> 00:07:46,699
这是美国宇航局从60年代末到70年代初期的月球模块的示意图。
This is a schematic diagram of NASA’s lunar module from the late ’60s and early ’70s.

115
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:49,440
我们可以看到这里指出的坐标框架。
We can see the coordinate frames indicated on here.

116
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,009
我们可以看到它们将滚动定义为围绕z轴的旋转，该旋转朝向前方
We can see that they define roll as rotation around the z-axis which is toward the front

117
00:07:55,009 --> 00:08:00,870
对于车辆而言，它们将偏航定义为围绕x轴（垂直方向）
of the vehicle and they have defined yaw as being around the x-axis which is the vertical

118
00:08:00,870 --> 00:08:04,130
该特定车辆的轴。
axis for this particular vehicle.

119
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:08,620
滚动，俯仰，偏航角度的MATLAB函数与Euler非常相似
The MATLAB functions for roll, pitch, yaw angles are very similar to those for Euler

120
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,620
角。
angles.

121
00:08:09,620 --> 00:08:14,430
我们使用函数rpy2r，我们传递滚动，俯仰，偏航角度。
We used the function rpy2r and we pass in the roll, pitch, yaw angles.

122
00:08:14,430 --> 00:08:16,550
我刚刚在这里编写了一些简单的数字。
I’ve just made up some simple numbers here.

123
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,660
滚动角为0.1
The roll angle is 0.1

124
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,660
弧度。
radians.

125
00:08:18,660 --> 00:08:20,690
俯仰角为0.2弧度。
The pitch angle is 0.2 radians.

126
00:08:20,690 --> 00:08:23,700
偏航角为0.3弧度。
And the yaw angle is 0.3 radians.

127
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,480
这是产生的正交旋转矩阵。
And this is the resulting orthogonal rotation matrix.

128
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:31,340
再一次，有一个反函数。
Once again, there is an inverse function.
