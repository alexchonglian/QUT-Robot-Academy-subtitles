1
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:06,680
让我们回顾一下本讲座中的一些重要概念。
Let’s recap some of the important concepts from this lecture.

2
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:12,740
首先，有一些非常重要的公约。首先是所谓的右手坐标
Firstly, there are some very important conventions. First is the so called right-handed coordinate

3
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:17,410
帧。当我们构造一个三维坐标系时，我们需要正确构造它
frame. When we construct a 3-dimensional coordinate frame, we need to construct it properly and

4
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:22,960
我们用右手指导我们。x轴与我们的拇指对齐，y轴对齐
we use our right hand to guide us. The x-axis is aligned with our thumb, the y-axis is aligned

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,989
用我们的食指和z轴用我们的中指。谈到描述
with our index finger and the z-axis with our middle finger. When it comes to describing

6
00:00:27,989 --> 00:00:33,329
围绕轴的旋转方向，我们想象我们正在抓住那个轴
the direction of rotation around an axis, we imagine that we’re grasping that axis

7
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:37,640
用我们的拇指指向箭头的方向和我们手指的方向
with our thumb pointing in the direction of the arrow and the direction that our fingers

8
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,929
绕轴线卷曲表示正旋转方向。
curl around the axis indicate the positive rotational direction.

9
00:00:42,929 --> 00:00:49,179
三维旋转矩阵可以用3×3矩阵和列来描述
A rotation matrix in three dimensions can be described by a 3 x 3 matrix and the columns

10
00:00:49,179 --> 00:00:55,780
该矩阵的单位矢量是与坐标系B的轴对齐的。第一个
of that matrix are unit vectors that are aligned with the axes of coordinate frame B. The first

11
00:00:55,780 --> 00:01:02,159
列是帧B的x轴，第二列是帧B的y轴和第三列
column is the x-axis of frame B, second column is the y-axis of frame B and the third column

12
00:01:02,159 --> 00:01:08,340
是框架B的z轴。并且，我们使用此旋转矩阵从框架旋转矢量
is the z-axis of frame B. And, we use this rotation matrix to rotate a vector from frame

13
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:12,590
B到框架A.有三个基本旋转矩阵
B to frame A. There are three elementary rotation matrices

14
00:01:12,590 --> 00:01:19,440
其对应于围绕x轴，y轴和z轴的旋转。我们可以创建一个
which correspond to rotation around the x-axis, the y-axis and the z-axis. We can create an

15
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:25,240
通过使用这些基本序列在任意两个坐标系之间进行任意旋转
arbitrary rotation between any two coordinate frames by using a sequence of these elementary

16
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:32,230
旋转。实际上有12种可能的旋转序列。一个重要的警告，欧拉的一部分
rotations. There are in fact 12 possible rotation sequences. An important caveat, part of Euler

17
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:40,040
旋转定理，就是没有两个连续的旋转可以绕同一轴。这个的
rotation theorem, is that no two consecutive rotations can be about the same axis. Of this

18
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:46,680
在图12中，这些序列中的6个被称为欧拉角。它们包含两个旋转
12, 6 of these sequences are referred to as Euler angles. They contain two rotations about

19
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:54,380
相同的轴，但不是顺序的。例如，旋转大约x，然后，y，然后再旋转x。虽然
the same axis, but not sequentially. For example, rotate about x, then, y, then x again. Although

20
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:59,070
所有这六个技术上都是欧拉角，当使用术语欧拉角时，人
all six of these technically are Euler angles, when the term Euler angles is used, people

21
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:05,890
通常是指特定的序列，ZYZ。但是，这种惯例因不同而异
are generally referring to the specific sequence, ZYZ. But, this convention varies across different

22
00:02:05,890 --> 00:02:09,560
工程学科。因此，确保与某人交谈时很重要
disciplines of engineering. So, it’s important to be sure when you’re talking to somebody

23
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:13,849
关于欧拉角，你说的是完全相同的序列。
about Euler angles that you’re talking about exactly the same sequence.

24
00:02:13,849 --> 00:02:18,569
其他六个被称为万向角。并且，经常提到其中两个
The other six are referred to as Cardan angles. And, two of these specifically are often referred

25
00:02:18,569 --> 00:02:25,509
作为滚动，俯仰，偏航角度。万向角具有围绕三个不同轴的旋转。
to as roll, pitch, yaw angles. The Cardan angles have rotations about three different axes.

26
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,260
我们可以用任何一个来描述旋转
We can describe the rotation from any one

27
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:34,969
在单个旋转方面框架到另一个，围绕某个轴旋转角度θ
frame to another in terms of a single rotation, a rotation by an angle Theta about some axis

28
00:02:34,969 --> 00:02:41,280
V.并且，我们讨论了在给定旋转矩阵的情况下确定Theta和V的技术。和，
V. And, we’ve discussed techniques to determine Theta and V given a rotation matrix. And,

29
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,739
我们介绍了Rodriguez方程，它允许我们从轴和角度走
we introduced the Rodriguez equation which allows us to go from an axis and an angle

30
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:52,950
回到旋转矩阵。我们介绍了四元数。这些都是超复杂的
back to a rotation matrix. We introduced quaternions. These are hypercomplex

31
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:58,810
数字。它们实际上包括标量和三元素向量。单位幅度四元数
numbers. They actually comprise a scalar and a three-element vector. A unit magnitude quaternion

32
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:04,180
它被称为单位四元数，可用于编码旋转。而且，那里
which is referred to as a unit quaternion can be used to encode rotation. And, there

33
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:09,849
是一些简单的规则来确定四元数的倒数和复合两个四元数，
are some simple rules to determine the inverse of a quaternion and to compound two quaternions,

34
00:03:09,849 --> 00:03:14,260
我们可以计算出两次连续旋转的效果。
and we can work out the effect of two consecutive rotations.

35
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,590
出现的一个重要问题是为什么我们使用像旋转这样的东西
An important question that comes up a lot is why do we use something like a rotation

36
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:25,249
矩阵。旋转矩阵是3乘3矩阵，它包含9个数字，但我们知道
matrix. A rotation matrix is a 3 by 3 matrix and it contains nine numbers, but we know

37
00:03:25,249 --> 00:03:31,099
根据欧拉定理，我们只需要三个数字-三个角度-来描述一个旋转。
from Euler’s theorem that we only need three numbers - three angles - to describe a rotation.

38
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:35,569
当我可以使用三个时，使用九个数字有什么好处？
What’s the advantage of using nine numbers when I could just use three?

39
00:03:35,569 --> 00:03:42,529
嗯，重要的是，旋转矩阵不仅仅是任何旧的3乘3矩阵。这是具体的
Well, importantly, the rotation matrix is not just any old 3 by 3 matrix. It is a specific

40
00:03:42,529 --> 00:03:47,980
矩阵。它是一个正交矩阵。所以，虽然有九个元素，但有一些
matrix. It is an orthonormal matrix. So, although there are nine elements, there are a number

41
00:03:47,980 --> 00:03:54,010
约束。实际上有六个约束条件，这使我们只有3个自由度。
of constraints. In fact there are six constraints, which leaves us with only 3 degrees of freedom.

42
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,549
第一个约束是该矩阵中的每列是单位向量。事实上，
The first constraints are that each column in this matrix is a unit vector. In fact,

43
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:03,540
每列是一个单位向量引入了三个约束。然后，列是
that each column is a unit vector introduces three constraints. And then, the columns are

44
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:08,809
它们彼此正交并引入另外三个约束。
all orthogonal to one another and that introduces another three constraints.

45
00:04:08,809 --> 00:04:13,639
旋转矩阵具有一些非常方便的属性。首先，我们可以复合姿势
The rotation matrix has some very convenient properties. Firstly, we can compound poses

46
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:20,479
或简单地通过乘法旋转。对于欧拉角度或滚动，俯仰，情况并非如此
or rotations simply by multiplication. That’s not the case for Euler angles or roll, pitch,

47
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:23,669
偏航角度。第二个非常重要的好处是
yaw angles. A second really important benefit is that

48
00:04:23,669 --> 00:04:30,169
旋转矩阵的列描述新坐标的x，y和z轴
the columns of a rotation matrix describe the x, y and z axes of the new coordinate

49
00:04:30,169 --> 00:04:35,120
框架就旧的而言。另一个重要的特性是你可以实际读取一个旋转
frame in terms of the old one. Another important property is that you can actually read a rotation

50
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:41,370
矩阵。旋转矩阵的列根据单位矢量x，y来描述
matrix. The columns of the rotation matrix describe in terms of unit vectors the x,y

51
00:04:41,370 --> 00:04:46,530
和新坐标系的z轴。让我们来看看其中的一些不同
and z-axis of the new coordinate frame. Let’s have a look at a few of the different

52
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:51,520
我们讨论过的旋转表示。我们可以有一个9的旋转矩阵
rotational representations that we’ve discussed. We can have a rotation matrix with its nine

53
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,960
数字在里面。而且，旋转矩阵的一个优点是没有可能
numbers in it. And, one of the advantages of rotation matrix is that there is no possibility

54
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:02,830
有一个奇点。我们谈到了奇点，万向节问题以及随之而来的问题
of having a singularity. We talked about singularities, the gimbal problem, and that occurs with

55
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:08,210
欧拉角或滚动，俯仰，偏航表示方向。
Euler angles or roll, pitch, yaw representation of orientation.

56
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:13,060
复合两次旋转很容易。对于旋转矩阵，我们简单地将两个矩阵相乘
Compounding two rotations is easy. For a rotation matrix, we simply multiply the two matrices

57
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:18,800
在一起，而对于三角表示，它是非常重要的。我们也可以考虑一下
together, whereas for the three-angle representations, it’s nontrivial. We can also consider that

58
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:25,259
我们可以用两个向量表示坐标系的方向;一个方法向量和一个
we can represent a coordinate frame’s orientation by two vectors; an approach vector and an

59
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:30,960
方向向量。这只是六个数字。这是奇点自由，但不是很容易
orientation vector. That’s just six numbers. It’s singularity free but not very easy

60
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:37,120
复合以这种形式表示的两个方向。我们还可以考虑角度+轴
to compound two orientations expressed in this form. We can also consider the angle + axis

61
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:42,720
取向。我们有一个数字来描述旋转量，角度和我们
orientation. We have one number to describe the amount of rotation, the angle, and we

62
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:49,300
需要两个数字来表示旋转轴。它是三维的单位向量，
need two more numbers to represent the rotational axis. It’s a unit vector in three dimensions,

63
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:54,360
所以它里面只有两个唯一的数字。这种表示是免费的，但是
so there are only two unique numbers in it. This representation is singularity free, but

64
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:59,370
表示零旋转有点问题。而且，再一次，复合两个
it’s a bit problematic to represent a zero rotation. And, once again, compounding two

65
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:05,949
轮换是不平凡的。最终表示是单位四元数。它有四个数字，
rotations is nontrivial. Final representation is the unit quaternion. It’s got four numbers,

66
00:06:05,949 --> 00:06:11,180
虽然只有三个是独一无二的，因为它有一个单位量级。这是奇点
though only three of them are unique because it’s got a unit magnitude. It’s singularity

67
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:16,689
自由。并且，我们引入哈密顿量积作为两个四元数乘法的方法。所以，
free. And, we introduced the Hamiltonian product as a way of multiplying two quaternions. So,

68
00:06:16,689 --> 00:06:21,819
在某些方面，四元数有很多优点，奇点自由，代表
in some respect, the quaternion has got a lot of advantages, singularity free, represented

69
00:06:21,819 --> 00:06:27,699
通过较少的数字，可以使用较少的算术将两个四元数相乘
by a fewer numbers, and two quaternions can be multiplied together using fewer arithmetic

70
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:32,699
操作比矩阵乘法的情况。在机器人技术中，它确实如此
operation than is the case for matrix multiplication. In robotics, it’s really

71
00:06:32,699 --> 00:06:37,569
常用的顶部和底部表示，旋转矩阵和
the top and bottom representation that are in common use, the rotation matrix and the

72
00:06:37,569 --> 00:06:41,090
单位四元数。最后，我们可以代表姿势，它具有
unit quaternion. Finally, we can represent pose, which has

73
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:46,650
通过单一的均匀变换得到平移分量和旋转分量
got both translational component and a rotational component, by a single homogeneous transformation

74
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:54,229
矩阵-一个4x4矩阵。相对姿势的组成通过乘以矩阵来完成。否定
matrix - a 4 x 4 matrix. Composition of relative poses is done by multiplying matrices. Negation

75
00:06:54,229 --> 00:06:59,810
或者通过反转矩阵来完成逆相对姿势。请记住，反转同质
or an inverse relative pose is done by inverting the matrix. Remember that inverting a homogeneous

76
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:06,169
转换矩阵不是通过转置来计算的。这只是一个属性
transformation matrix is not computed by taking its transpose. That’s a property only of

77
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:11,919
旋转矩阵。并且，将矢量表示的点从一帧转换为
a rotation matrix. And, transforming a point represented by a vector from one frame to

78
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:18,560
另一种是通过将点的均匀表示乘以同质来完成的
another is done by multiplying homogeneous representation of the point by a homogeneous

79
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,110
变换矩阵。最后要记住的是，协调帧
transformation matrix. Final thing to remember, coordinate frames

80
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:29,250
是你的朋友当您尝试描述复杂问题时，请使用大量的问题。连接
are your friend. Use lots of them when you’re trying to describe a complex problem. Attach

81
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:34,050
它们对每个感兴趣的对象都写下它们之间的关系
them to every object of interest and write them the relationships between the coordinate

82
00:07:34,050 --> 00:07:37,960
帧。一些关系可能是不变的。其中一些关系可能会
frames. Some of the relationships might be constant. Some of those relationships might

83
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:41,889
是时变的。并且，请记住，NASA使用它们。他们一定很好。
be time varying. And, remember, NASA uses them. They must be good.
