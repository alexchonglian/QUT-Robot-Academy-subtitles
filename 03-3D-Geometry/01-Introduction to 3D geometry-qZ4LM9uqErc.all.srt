00:00:03,609 --> 00:00:08,869
在上一节课中，我们讨论了如何描述两个物体的位置
In the last lecture we talked about how we described the position of objects in a two

2
00:00:08,869 --> 00:00:10,050
维度世界。
dimensional world.

3
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:14,380
我们使用了这个例子，例如机器人，我们创建了一个二维坐标
We used the example, for instance, a robot and we created a two dimensional coordinate

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:15,380
帧。
frame.

5
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:19,210
我们将坐标框架放在参考位置，我们可以描述位置
We placed the coordinate frame at a reference location and we can describe the position

6
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:22,520
关于那个坐标框架的机器人。
of the robot with respect to that co-ordinate frame.

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:27,140
我们还谈到了我们如何描述物体的方向;那是机器人的方式
We also talked about how we describe the orientation of the object; that is which way the robot

8
00:00:27,140 --> 00:00:31,469
相对于该坐标系上的轴指向。
is pointing with respect to the axes on this co-ordinate frame.

9
00:00:31,469 --> 00:00:35,489
现在我们要做的是提高复杂程度并引入
Now what we are going to do is to kick it up a level of complexity and introduce the

10
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:36,570
第三维度。
third dimension.

11
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,910
因此对于大多数机器人而言，第三维非常重要。
So for most robotics the third dimension is really important.

12
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:44,350
例如，机器人可以在任何类型的真实机器人手中移动
The robots hand for instance, in any sort of real robot, the hand is going to move in

13
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:47,460
一架飞机，但它也可以上下移动。
a plane, but it is also going to be able to move up and down.

14
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:52,720
所以我们需要能够描述三维物体的位置和方向
So we need to be able to describe the position and orientation of bodies in three-dimensional

15
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,720
空间。
space.

16
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:57,329
但是也有很多机器人在三维空间中移动。
But there are also a lot of robots that move in three-dimensional space.

17
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,110
所以我在这里有一架模型飞机，或者一架飞机在空中飞行。
So here I have a model airplane, or course an airplane flies through the air.

18
00:01:01,110 --> 00:01:02,409
它上升而且下降。
It goes up and it goes down.

19
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:07,130
它可以左右移动，也可以通过多种有趣的方式旋转。
It can move left and right, and it can also rotate in a number of interesting ways.

20
00:01:07,130 --> 00:01:14,200
它可以向上和向下倾斜，它可以像这样偏转，它可以像这样滚动。
It can pitch up and down, it can yaw like this, and it can roll like this.

21
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:19,280
所以水下机器人是另一个例子，他们有点像这样但不是飞行
So underwater robots are another example, they are a bit like this but instead of flying

22
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:21,390
他们在空中飞过水面。
through the air, they are flying through the water.

23
00:01:21,390 --> 00:01:25,690
所以这些是今天两个非常重要的机器人类，飞行机器人和机器人
So these are two really important classes of robots today, robots that fly and robots

24
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:30,700
在水下游泳，他们的运动用三维方式描述
that swim under the water and their motion is described in terms of three-dimensional

25
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:31,700
空间。
space.

26
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:35,619
也许这样一个简单的轮式机器人，我们可以通过描述它来实现
Where perhaps a simple wheeled robot like this, we could get by with just describing it’s

27
00:01:35,619 --> 00:01:39,380
位置和它在二维空间方面的方向。
position and it’s orientation in terms of two-dimensional space.
