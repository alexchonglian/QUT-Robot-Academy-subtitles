00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,670
当我们讨论工业型机器人时，描述方向很重要
When we're discussing industrial type robots, it's important to describe the orientation

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:12,420
末端执行器，夹子-通过拾取完成工作的机器人的一部分
of the end effector, the gripper - the piece of the robot that does the work by picking

3
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:18,090
将物体放下并放下。这类机器人的常见惯例是什么
objects up and putting them down. The common convention in this type of robotics is what's

4
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:24,200
称为2轴表示。我们首先定义一个名为the的向量
called the 2-axis representation. We start off by defining a vector which is called the

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,670
接近矢量，这是与机器人手指平行的矢量。我们定义
approach vector and that's the vector that's parallel to the fingers of the robot. We define

6
00:00:28,670 --> 00:00:32,980
另一个我们称之为方向向量的向量，它是连接的向量
another vector which we call the orientation vector and that's the vector that joins the

7
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:39,220
两根手指的提示。所以这说明了机器人手指的扭曲
tips of two fingers. So that says something about the twist of the robot fingers around

8
00:00:39,220 --> 00:00:45,800
方法向量。对于很多机器人操作任务，只需了解方法即可
the approach vector. And for a lot of robotic manipulation tasks, just knowing the approach

9
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,360
矢量和方向矢量足以能够描述夹具的方向。
vector and the orientation vector is sufficient to be able to describe the orientation of the gripper.

10
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:57,020
为了创建一个右手坐标系，我们引入了一个刚刚调用的第三个向量
In order to create a right-handed coordinate frame we introduce a third vector just called

11
00:00:57,020 --> 00:01:01,850
法向量。现在我们可以将夹具的方向表示为正交
the normal vector. Now we can express the orientation of the gripper as an orthonormal

12
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:08,359
旋转矩阵。我们通过将N向量，O向量和向量堆叠为列来实现
rotation matrix. We do that by stacking up as columns the N vector, the O vector and

13
00:01:08,359 --> 00:01:14,659
A矢量。我们可以将其扩展为3x3矩阵，每列都是元素
the A vector. We're can expand this out as a 3 x 3 matrix and each column are the elements

14
00:01:14,659 --> 00:01:21,969
N，O和A向量。所有这些列必须是正交的。所以，如果我们知道A和
of the N, O and A vectors. All of these columns must be orthogonal. So if we know the A and

15
00:01:21,969 --> 00:01:28,799
在O向量中，我们可以计算N向量作为O和A向量的叉积。
the O vector, we can compute the N vector as the cross product of the O and the A vector.

16
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,389
这里简要回顾一下与正交矩阵相关的规则。一点
Here's a quick recap on the rules that relate the columns of an orthogonal matrix. A little

17
00:01:35,389 --> 00:01:42,319
我用来帮助记忆的技巧是考虑N，O和A写在圆形上
trick that I use to aid my memory is to consider that N, O and A are written on a circular

18
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:46,340
条纸。我们从我们想知道的符号开始，并且等于十字架
strip of paper. We start with the symbol that we want to know, and is equal to the cross

19
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,389
围绕圈子的下两个产品。
product of the next two around the circle.

20
00:01:49,389 --> 00:01:54,340
在这里，我有一个非常简单的机器人，我们在这里有我们的世界坐标框架
Here I have a very simple robot and we have our world coordinate frame here, which is

21
00:01:54,340 --> 00:02:00,729
我们对位置和方向的参考。而这个机器人将要拿起这个电池。
our reference for both position and for orientation. And this robot is going to pick up this battery.

22
00:02:00,729 --> 00:02:05,669
为此，我们需要描述夹具的位置和方向。
In order to do that, we need to describe both the position and the orientation of the gripper.

23
00:02:05,669 --> 00:02:09,170
可能是因为我们想要像这样或我们这样的抓手方向拿起电池
It might be that we want to pick up the battery with a gripper orientation like this or we

24
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:13,760
可能想要像这样的抓手方向拿起电池。无论哪种方式我们都需要
might want to pick up the battery with a gripper orientation like this. Either way we need

25
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,660
能够描述夹具的方向。所以我们做了以前做过的事，
to be able to describe the orientation of the gripper. So we do what we've done before,

26
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:23,890
与其他对象。我们将坐标框架附加到机器人的抓手上。我们定位
with other objects. We attach a coordinate frame to the gripper of the robot. We orient

27
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:28,620
它使z轴向外指向。我们将此称为接近向量。它的
it so that the z-axis is pointing outwards. We refer to this as the approach vector. It's

28
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,130
通常是抓手接近物体的方向。我们有另一个向量
generally the direction in which the gripper approaches the object. We have another vector

29
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:37,590
我们称之为方向矢量，并且与夹具坐标的y轴平行
which we call the orientation vector and is parallel to the y-axis of the gripper's coordinate

30
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,620
框架，这是抓手的方向。我们是否希望抓手的手指像这样
frame and that is the orientation of the gripper. Do we want the gripper's fingers like this

31
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:47,950
或者像这样。第三个向量，x轴我们称为法向量。
or like this. And the third vector, the x-axis we refer to as the normal vector.
